    <h1>pearweb QA subsection</h1>


    <p class="para">It seems that there is a lack of QA material in the manual that
    people agree on and there is also need to make it move visible for people
    so they will actually follow those rules/guidelines. The QA team will
    therefore get its own QA subsection in the manual and will have control
    over it just like package maintainer controls package related docs in the
    manual.</p>

    <p class="para">The QA team also gets its own subsection on pearweb so people can
    more easily access QA material which is too dynamic or just related to the
    QA team own internal documentation purposes. There the QA will, for
    example, publish their latest decisions.</p>

    <p class="para">Furthermore here the QA team will be able to provide interfaces to
    QA team services. For example, here the QA team could offer an interface
    for maintainers to configure the access rights they want to grant the QA.
    Finally the core QA team can add QA related notes to each package homepage
    to communicate QA related information to the user base.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Approving first stable release</h2>

      <p class="para">The QA team needs to approve the first stable release of any major
      version.</p>

      <p class="para">For this purpose maintainers upload the release to PEARweb and
      contact the QA team with a link to the release, then QA will decide if
      the release is ready or not. The core QA team will at this point approve
      the release through PEAR web and release it for the maintainer.</p>

      <blockquote class="note">
        <p class="para">The QA team must always inform the current lead maintainers of
        any changes that are done to a given package using the currently
        configured email addresses on pear web.</p>
      </blockquote>


      <blockquote class="note">
        <p class="para">The core QA team may delegate tasks as much as possible to other
        QA team members. However no access rights will be assigned just for
        the sake of delegating a task (so members of the QA team may package a
        new release, but only members of the core QA team will have the
        necessary rights to upload the release).</p>
