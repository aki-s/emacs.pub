       If you want to contribute your code to PEAR in form of a new
       package or as an addition to an existing package, it has to be
       compliant to a set of <a href="standards.html" class="link">Coding
       Standards</a>. There have been numerous discussions about
       whether those standards are good or not, and we have arbitrarily
       decided that they are good and that the discussion is over.  Please
       respect this decision and don&#039;t bring up changes to the
       basic coding standards, or you risk being ignored mercilessly.

       Always keep in mind that your code should be extensible and that
       it has to be easy to add new features in the future. If it is
       easily predictable for you that there is no clean way to add new
       functionality to the codebase without breaking backwards
       compatibility, you should consider to review the code and to
       adapt it, <em class="emphasis">before</em> contributing it to PEAR.

      <p class="para">
       To this end, most PEAR packages make use of object oriented programming.
       Through concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, patterns like
       singleton/factory/command, PEAR packages solve problems in elegant ways.
       There are numerous resources about object oriented
       programming all around the web and you will also find tons of
       books available for your reading pleasure. However we can can
       recommend <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/concepts/" class="link external">Object-Oriented Programming
       Concepts</a> on <a href="http://java.sun.com/" class="link external">Sun&#039;s Java

        is fully capable of converting in-code API documentation and external
        tutorials into Docbook XML. PhpDocumentor version 1.2.2 or

        should be generated directly into the

        Be aware though that only shipping the API documentation does
        not suffice! Additionally your package has to come with usage

       All developers have experienced the frustration of bugs.  They are a fact

       be used to catch them, kill them, and prevent their return.  Regression
       tests should be included with every stable release, so that users can
       run them if a bug occurs to help you debug the package.  Examples of
       .phpt regression tests can be found as part of the
       <a href="core.pear.pear.html" class="link">PEAR</a> package in SVN.  For examples of

      <span class="simpara">
       If you are not willing to maintain your code over a long period
       of time, it makes little sense to contribute it. PEAR is the
       standard repository of PHP packages, and this comes with great
       responsibility.  Maintaining means more than just providing

       You must be willing to not only fix bugs, but also integrate useful
       enhancements contributed by users of your packages, if they fit the
       design specifications of your package.  You should expect to release
       new versions of your package regularly with bug fixes.  If you will be
       unable to maintain your package for an extended period of time, it is
       expected that you will announce this to the PEAR developer mailing list,
       and assign another temporary lead maintainer or publicly document the fact
       that your package is temporarily unmaintained, and the approximate date
       that users can expect to receive support and bug fixes, if possible.

        Code can be removed from PEAR if the lead maintainers
