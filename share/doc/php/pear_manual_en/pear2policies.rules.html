    <p class="para">
     All collective members have full commit access and can commit minor
     bugfixes without requesting permission or notifying lead developers.
     However, as a courtesy, it is expected that all developers will communicate
     with a package&#039;s lead developers prior to taking action.
     If a dispute over a commit arises, it is also expected that the commit
     in question will be reverted pending a review.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
This rule is intended to encourage open and friendly collaboration. For an example of this commit model, the PHP project developers often commit minor fixes for thread-safe errors, spelling mistakes, and other obvious mistakes without consultation.
Exceptions can be made to this rule with explicit PEAR Group approval documented on the website.

   <div class="section" id="pear2policies.rules.packagedesign"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Handling package design</h2></div>
    
     <p class="para">
      All design decisions should be discussed freely in a Collective, and
      each Collective is responsible for enforcing these decisions in
      their own way. Some Collectives may require packages to adhere to basic
      interfaces, others may require common data storage formats, but
      individual package maintainers must adhere to these decisions or
      discuss ways of improving them. No cowboy coding!
      Ultimately, individual package developers have the full freedom
      to innovate without expecting too much interference, but are expected
      to learn how to both give and receive constructive criticism as a part
      of the privilege of having their code hosted at pear.php.net.

   <div class="section" id="pear2policies.rules.pullingreleases"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Pulling releases</h2></div>
    
    <p class="para">
      All collective members can pull a release within 24 hours if there is
      a major regression or security bug. If at all possible, the primary lead
      maintainers should perform this action, but Collectives function as a
      unit, and have the role of policing huge problems.

    <p class="para">Competing packages are allowed at the alpha level in PEAR2.</p>
    <p class="para">All alpha/devel stability packages have no claim to a package name.
    If a better package comes along that does the same thing, wants your
    package&#039;s name and achieves beta status, you have to either join forces or
    change the name of your package. The limit is that newer packages have to
    be unarguably better in implementation. It is up to the Collective to
    define &quot;unarguably better&quot;</p>
