    <h1>The issues</h1>


    <p class="para">For PEAR to continue to grow, and encourage contributors, testers,
    writers and users. It is important (in the view of the RFC author) to make
    the decision process within PEAR to be as open and fair as
    possible.</p>

    <p class="para">Due to historical issues of long, rather pointless, and heated
    discussions on the pear-dev mailing list, Some rules have been made in the
    privacy of the pear-group mailing lists with little consultation with the
    community at large. This, (in the view of the author of this RFC) is
    something that is a serious mistake and must strongly be prevented in the
    future.</p>

        <p class="para">This public battering has discouraged contributors to put
        forward ideas to improve PEAR, or even keep subscribing to
        pear-dev.</p>

      <li class="listitem">
        <p class="para">It is impossible to gauge the community support for rules that
