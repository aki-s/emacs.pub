   Weblogs are an important part of the internet: They allow normal
   people to express their opinions and thoughts to their family, friends
   and the whole world by simply publishing some text on a server. This
   process is very easy and you don&#039;t need a grade in computer science to
   even host a blog on your own or a rented server.
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  One drawback of blog software is mostly their user interface: Since it is
  browser based, it requires you to be either online all the time while writing
  your blog post, or write it in a normal text editor and copy&amp;paste it
  when going online. Using a text editor you cannot apply font styles to your
  text.. An offline tool to write blog entries would be really nice in this
  case.
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  Considering the idea of an offline tool for writing blog entries leads to
  the availability of access to your blog from outside the normal web interface
  - e.g via web services. Most blog hosters and blogging software packages
  have support for such a web services API, mostly via XML-RPC.
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  Unfortunately, there are many different of these application programming
  interfaces in the wild. Some of them support only posting of blog entries,
  other ones also allow reading. Some blog softwares support images and tags
  in their posts, others not. The variety is large, and so you could end up
  writing custom code for every blog server you want to access because of the
  differences in their API.
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  This is the point at which <strong class="classname">Services_Blogging</strong> comes into
  play: It provides a unified API to post and read blog entries, independent of
  the API supported by the server software hosting the blog. It uses a
  driver-based approach to communicate with different APIs out there.
  If a new blogging API is invented, someone just needs to write a driver for
  the <strong class="classname">Services_Blogging</strong> package, and everyone can access
  also this blogs.
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  As of April 2007, the package has the following drivers:
  </p><ul class="itemizedlist">
   <li class="listitem"><p class="para">Blogger</p></li>
   <li class="listitem"><p class="para">LiveJournal</p></li>
   <li class="listitem"><p class="para">MetaWeblog</p></li>
