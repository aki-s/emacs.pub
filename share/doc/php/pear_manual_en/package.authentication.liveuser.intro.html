   <p class="para">
    <strong class="classname">LiveUser</strong> is an advanced authentication and permission
    framework that comes with a large array of out of the box
    features which can be used optionally.

    In short, the LiveUser package, provides Access Control List (ACL) functionality.

    The base class is called <strong class="classname">LiveUser</strong> and is often
    referred to as the &quot;client&quot;
    and is what will be commonly be used to authenticate a specific user
    and then optionally make permission checks on this user.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    LiveUser provides the following key features:

    The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured to
    use a certain permission container and one or more different
    auth containers.

    That means, you can have your users&#039; data scattered amongst many data
    containers and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until
    the user is found.

    For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account
    online on the webserver&#039;s local database.

    Also, you want to enable all your company&#039;s employees to login to the site
    without the need to create new accounts for all of  them.

    To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the
    LiveUser class.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage
    the rights for each user.

    Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
    for your application while having one consistent API.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    Using different permission and auth containers,
    it&#039;s easily possible to integrate newly written applications with older ones
    that have their own ways of storing permissions and user data.

    Just make a new container type and you&#039;re ready to go!
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    Currently available are containers using:
    PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, ext/PDO, PEAR::XML_Tree, Session and PEAR::Auth.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    There is also an external <a href="http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/LiveUser/" class="link external">wiki</a>

   <p class="para">
    At this point LiveUser is still in beta stage.

    Even so LiveUser is already being used
    on a wide range of production websites.

    A non exhaustive list can be found
    <a href="http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/LiveUser/References" class="link external">here</a>.

   <p class="para">
    The current roadmap for LiveUser can be viewed
    <a href="http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/LiveUser/Client" class="link external">here</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    A detailed introduction to the core concepts of LiveUser can be found
    in the following phpmag
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224817/http://www.php-mag.net/magphpde/magphpde_article/psecom,id,595,nodeid,21.html" class="link external">article</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    This article was published in april 2004 and is therefore not entirely
    uptodate.

    However the core principles remain unchanged and most of the recent changes
    resolve around making the API more consistent and flexible.

    As a result the API examples are mostly out of date.

    The article also fails to mention the fact that the permission containers
    are now separated in a logic and a storage layer.

    This was done to remove logic duplication as well as to allow the
    implementation of a stackable storage approach, where users could configure
    LiveUser to first call a cache storage layer, which in turn would fetch
    the necessary data on demand from the actual storage layer.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    A more recent article providing a step by step guide to LiveUser and the
    different permission containers can be found
    <a href="http://www.gvngroup.be/doc/LiveUser/index.php" class="link external">here</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    Before you can use LiveUser you will need to setup the necessary data
    structures for the chosen container.

    Through the use of the configuration options it is possible to customize
    alot of the aspects of the storage layer.

    Most notably it is possible to alias field and table names.

    This should make it possible to integrate any legacy data into LiveUser.

    Depending on the container chosen you may have to use the database schema
    installer.

    The installer requires the MDB2_Schema and MDB2 packages and is able to
    handle most configuration options properly to be able to install the
    database schema directly into your database.

    You can find the install class in &quot;[PEAR]/data/misc/schema/install.php&quot;.

    There is some sample code which is partially commented out at the top.

    Basically it&#039;s a two step process for both the auth and perm: (1)
    generate the schema xml file, (2) install the schema.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    During the installation process the installer will create backup files of
    the installed schema.

    These files will enable the installer to attempt to alter the database if
    run again with a different configuration.

    However if these files exist the installer will always attempt to alter
    instead of creating the tables from scratch as long as you are using the sam
    DSN.

    If for some reason you need to create the tables from scratch again then
    please delete the backup files with the matching DSN.

    You can find the installer inside the data directory of your pear install
    directory.

    Its called install.php and at the top of the file you will find a number of
    sample API calls which are commented out.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    An ER diagram of the database structure can be found
    <a href="http://www.backendmedia.com/LiveUser/liveuser_db_schema.png" class="link external">here</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    The diagram details what tables are needed
    for what permission complexity level.

    If you want to prevent the installer from installing tables you don&#039;t need
    you can modify the &quot;tables&quot; property of the instance of the permission
    container you pass to the generateSchema() method in the installer.

   <p class="para">
    In order to get started with LiveUser the following
    <a href="http://jystewart.net/process/archives/2005/07/configuring-liveuser/" class="link external">two</a>
    <a href="http://jystewart.net/process/archives/2005/08/getting-started-with-liveuser-permissions/" class="link external">articles</a> should
    help in getting off the ground.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    The observer support in LiveUser allows users to automatically have LiveUser
    call certain callbacks on a number of internal events.

    It is documented
    <a href="http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/LiveUser/Observers" class="link external">here</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    LiveUser also ship with a wide range of examples.

    These will be installed into the &quot;docs&quot; directory in your PEAR install
    directory.
    They try to illustrate various usage scenarios.

    The database examples come with a schema file please see the demodata.php
    in the examples root folder of the LiveUser package for details on how to
    install these schema files from the command line or from a browser.
    You will once again need MDB2_Schema to be able to install the schema files.
