      <h2 class="title">Fixing bugs/making releases</h2>

      <p class="para">If any QA related issues are found in a package that QA has not
      been granted permission to change without consulting the maintainer,the
      QA team will file a bug report. If the issue remains unresolved for 1
      month (2+1+1 weeks; see below), QA may fix it themselves.</p>

      <p class="para">If the issue isn&#039;t fixed with in two weeks QA will email the
      maintainers about the issue (if the bug system won&#039;t have auto bug
      report notices every X week in the future) and if the problem isn&#039;t
      fixed within one week from that, QA will send yet another email to the
      maintainers and if no answer nor fix to the problem is provided within
      one week, all members of the core QA team will get the permission to
      modify any file needed to fix that QA issue as well as make a new
      release.</p>

      <p class="para">If any <em class="emphasis">major</em> QA issues are found in any
      package and the QA team doesn&#039;t have permission to change that package
      without contacting the lead first then the QA team will file a bug
      report. Any major issues can stay open for 2 weeks (5+5+4 days; see
      below), QA may fix it themselves.</p>

      <p class="para">If the issue isn&#039;t fixed within 5 days QA will email the
      maintainers about the issue (if the bug system won&#039;t have auto bug
      report notices every X week in the future) and if the problem isn&#039;t
      fixed with in 5 days, from that QA will send yet another email to the
      maintainers and if no answer nor fix to the problem is provided with in
      4 days, all members of the core QA team will have permission to modify
      any file needed to fix that QA issue as well as make a new
      release.</p>

      <p class="para">The same time frames apply when the QA team want to make a release
      because of unreleased fixes/improvements which are only available via
      SVN, or when the QA team wants to determine if a package has been
      orphaned (using the time frames specified for non major issues).</p>

      <p class="para">The QA team can decide what are major issues after discussion on
      the QA Mailing-list.</p>

      <p class="para">The QA team will for this reason keep track of those QA issues in
      their pear web subsection. This would only be for having overview over
      which package maintainers need to be emailed for reminders and such
      things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.qa-team.rights.orphan">
      <h2 class="title">Orphaned Packages</h2>

      <p class="para">The QA team can use the above stated rules to determine if a
      package is orphaned. The core QA team gets lead rights on all orphaned
      packages until the original maintainer returns or a new maintainer is
      found.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.qa-team.rights.deleting">
      <h2 class="title">Deleting Package releases</h2>

      <p class="para">The core QA team also has the permission to delete any release
      that might have any issues that have been found after the release, to
      reduce the effects of the problem. This right must be exercised with
      caution.</p>

      <p class="para">Package maintainers can also grant QA the rights to make a
      releases for their packages.</p>
