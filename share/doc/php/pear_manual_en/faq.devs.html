    I have written a PHP module in C. What are the rules of including

  <p class="para">

 <div class="section" id="faq.separated"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">
    Why is PEAR separated into pear/ and pear-core/?
   </h2></div>
  
  
  <p class="simpara">
    The first elements of PEAR were stored in the directory pear-core (once php-src/pear)
    and so they were bundled with each new PHP release.
   </p>
  <p class="simpara">
    For future releases of PEAR this isn&#039;t workable because PEAR will
    become too big to be bundled with every release of PHP. So there
    was a decision to commit all new elements to an own top level
    directory pear. The other elements which are currently remaining
    in php-src/pear will be moved to the new top level directory soon.
    Only the PEAR package manager code will be bundled with every new
    release automatically.
   </p>
 </div>


 <div class="section" id="faq.directory-structure"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">
    Why does the directory structure of pear/ and pear-core/ differ?
   </h2></div>
  
  
  <p class="para">
    The directory structure of <code class="filename">pear-core/</code>
    matches that of the install tree (by default
    <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/php</code>), and are organized as a
    simple hierarchy.  However, the directory structure of
    <code class="filename">pear/</code> is based on what package the files
    belong to.  Where files are located in each package directory is
    completely independent from where they end up being installed,
    this is all determined by the package description file.
   </p>
 </div>


 <div class="section" id="faq.flat-structure"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">
    Why a flat directory structure instead of a deep?
   </h2></div>
  
  
  <p class="simpara">
    In SVN, PEAR code is organized by package instead of hierarchical
    like it would finally be installed.  For example, if you want to
    use the XML_RPC class, you include &quot;XML/RPC.php&quot;.  It&#039;s easy to
    think that in SVN, this file should be in pear/XML/RPC.php, but
    that&#039;s not the case.  XML_RPC is an independent package with its
    own directory in SVN, in this case the RPC.php file is actually
    located at pear/XML_RPC/RPC.php.  The package description file
    (package.xml) is used to say where the files should finally be
    installed.
   </p>
  <p class="simpara">
    The reason SVN is organized this way is that it makes package
    administration much easier.

  <p class="para">
    Yes. But make sure, that you mark up the experimental/unstable
    status of the project in the documentation. The best place to do
    this is in the <code class="filename">package.xml</code> in the

    Am I expected to add examples and/or test files to my package and

   </h2></div>
  
  
  <p class="para">
    Examples are a good idea, especially when your class has a complex
    API. But examples are only a part of a documentation. Don&#039;t create
    examples instead of a documentation. You should store the
    documentation and the examples in a sub directory &#039;docs&#039; of the
    package directory.
   </p>
  <p class="para">
    Test scripts are recommended when your class has to be compiled,
    requires special extensions/programs or needs correctly installed
    additional files (i.e. templates, graphics). Store them in sub
    directory called &#039;tests&#039;.

    There is no problem with competitive packages, but we want to
    avoid pollution with 10 template classes, 7 different mail classes,
    and 3 different layers for databases doing the same only with
    different function names.
   </p>
  <p class="para">
    First of all, do a reality check: Why do I want to commit a new
    package? Really bad answers are "<span class="quote">To see my name in
    PEAR</span>" or "<span class="quote">I didn&#039;t understand the API of the existing
    class</span>".
   </p>
  <p class="para">
    A good reason for a new class is often, that you are missing a
    function, behaviour or speed in an existing implementation. In
    this case, you  should take a look at this class, if it possible
    to extend this class. If not, then you have a good reason to
    commit a new class. "<span class="quote">If not</span>" means, it isn&#039;t possible
    to add the required functionality without changing the basics of
    this class.
   </p>
  <p class="simpara">
    If you write a new class, try to keep API compatibility with
    existing classes as far as possible! If it isn&#039;t  possible to keep
    the class compatible himself, try to create a wrapper class to
    keep compatibility. Don&#039;t care, if this wrapper needs a lot of
    time or memory, a wrapper class only has to keep compatibility and
    make migration easier.

    The allowed licenses were chosen to allow integration into closed source,
    open source as well as commercial applications.  The only limitation is that
    the original credits must stay in the sources.  For LGPL the license additionally
    requires that all changes to the source code must be licensed under the LGPL

     From time to time people raise concerns of using PEAR packages
     licensed under the PHP license in GPL&#039;ed code.  In a discussion
     about this topic, the creator of PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf, issued the

       It all comes down to semantics of what linking means.  The PHP
       license is pretty much identical to the Apache license and you
       could indeed make a case for not allowing any GPL&#039;ed software to
       be &quot;linked to&quot; from Apache either.

       This hair splitting over linking, derivation and aggregation has
       been going on since the beginning of time.  My stance is that you
       can indeed ship PHP licensed PEAR components on the same cd or in
       the same tarball as GPL&#039;ed code because I see it as an aggregate
       work.  This changes if you take PEAR code, modify it and
       copy-paste it directly into your own work.  Then it moves from
       aggregate to derived.  But the intent of the PEAR components is
       to be used in aggregate form.  The PHP license allows you to use
       it in derived form as well, of course, but then you should be
       choosing a license other than the GPL for the derived work.

       That text is heavily biased towards compiled software and they
       talk about executables and memory spaces which don&#039;t really apply
       in this case.  If you don&#039;t consider using a PEAR component as
       aggregation then it logically follows that you also cannot have
       Apache call your code so you will have to stipulate that nobody
       can use your code from Apache. I think this is an extreme
       interpretation that pretty much nobody out there shares.

  <p class="para">
    For PECL extensions that are linked into PHP, the license
    must be compatible with the PHP license.  That means you can not GPL
    a PECL extension or you would be violating the GPL.  Note also that if
    you write an extension that links against a GPL&#039;ed library you will be
    violating the GPL.  If you need to link against a GPL&#039;ed library, get
    permission from the author of the library to use the library under a
    compatible license.
   </p>
  <p class="para">
    The license of any PEAR/PECL package can be found in the head of
    all source code files, inside the &lt;license&gt; tag of the package
    description file (<code class="filename">package.xml</code>) and also on the package
    homepage.

 <div class="section" id="faq.tabs-vs-spaces"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">
    Why does the PEAR coding standard insist on space-only indentation?
   </h2></div>
  
  
  <p class="para">
    Using spaces and avoiding tabs is the only way to ensure that a
    piece of code is rendered consistently in all editors and viewers.
    Many editors render tabs as 4 spaces, and a lot of editors,
    terminal programs and utilities render tabs as 8 spaces.  Example:

    <p class="literallayout">printf(&quot;%s&quot;,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$arg);</p>
<p>

    Here, there are 7 spaces before &quot;$arg&quot;.  If this code was written
    in an editor with 4-space tabs, it would store it as one tab and
    three spaces.  Now, if another developer edits the same file in an
    editor with 8-space tabs, it will look like this:

    <p class="literallayout">printf(&quot;%s&quot;,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$arg);</p>

  
  <p class="para">
    Likewise, consider this code written with 8-space tabs:

    <p class="literallayout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;($foo&nbsp;&amp;&amp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$bar)&nbsp;{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p>

    If viewed in a 4-space-tab editor, it will look like this:

    <p class="literallayout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;($foo&nbsp;&amp;&amp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$bar)&nbsp;{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

  
  <p class="simpara">
    In a community like PEAR where people use lots of different
    systems and editors, using tabs simply doesn&#039;t work.  People will
    end up doing whitespace commits fixing rendering in their editor,
    while breaking it for others.

    With only spaces it will look the same to everyone.
