   <p class="simpara">
    There are numerous ways to support the PEAR project, that are described
    in this part of the guide.

   <div class="section" id="guide.dev.supporting.bugs"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Reporting and fixing bugs</h2></div>
    
    

    <p class="para">
     There is a chapter devoted to reporting and fixing bugs in the
     &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; section of the manual, found
     <a href="contributing.bugs.html" class="link">here</a>.
    </p>

   <div class="section" id="guide.dev.supporting.new-features"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Contributing new features to packages</h2></div>
    
    
    <p class="para">
     If you have a feature you would like to see included in a package,
     don&#039;t hesitate to contact the maintainer of the package. You can
     find out who the maintainer of a package is by browsing the     
     <a href="http://pear.php.net/packages.php" class="link external">package list</a>
     on the PEAR website and selecting the desired package. The
     maintainer(s) is/are listed on the package information page.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="section" id="guide.dev.supporting.maintainership"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Becoming the new maintainer for an unmaintained package</h2></div>
    
    

    <p class="para">
     If a developer has given up the maintainership of his package, you
     can take over this job. If you feel brave enough to answer support
     questions, fix bugs and manage release cycles, you can contact the
     previous maintainer or the 
     <a href="mailto:pear-dev@lists.php.net" class="link external">PEAR developers mailing list</a>
     and announce your will to maintain the package.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="section" id="guide.dev.supporting.wishlists"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Buying things from wishlists</h2></div>
    
    

    <p class="para">
     For all the PEAR developers, PEAR is a project they are working
     on in their free-time, which means that they don&#039;t earn any money
     with it. If you or the company you are working for is using a
     PEAR package in one of your/their (commercial) products, you/they can
     do this for free, of course. But if you think that the author of
     the package you are using desires some credits, it would be nice
     to buy something from his wishlist at
     <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" class="link external">Amazon</a> or another
     internet store. To see if a PEAR developer has registered his
     wishlist, surf to the 
     <a href="http://pear.php.net/accounts.php" class="link external">Account information
     page</a> and select the developer from the list there. If he
     has a wishlist, it&#039;s noted somewhere on the detail page.
