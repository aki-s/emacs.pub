</div>
   
   

   <p class="para">
    To be able to use the proposal tool (<a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/" class="link external">PEPr</a>), you have <a href="http://pear.php.net/account-request.php" class="link external">to apply for a PEAR website
    account</a>. This account will usually be granted within one or
    two days. After that you can open a new proposal using the
    "<span class="quote"><a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-edit.php" class="link external">New Package
    Proposal</a></span>" interface.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    The package proposal process is divided into 4 stages:
    "<span class="quote">Draft</span>", "<span class="quote">Proposal</span>", "<span class="quote">Call for
    Votes</span>" and "<span class="quote">Finished</span>". Every proposal has to run
    through all of these stages. During each stage (except for the draft
    stage) an email is send to you (the proposer) and the <a href="mailto:pear-dev@lists.php.net" class="link external">PEAR developers mailing list</a>
    for any action.
   </p>

   <div class="section" id="newmaint.proposal.step3.stage1"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Stage 1: Creating a draft</h2></div>
    

    <p class="para">
     At first your proposal is a draft. This simply means you can edit
     it, view it and it is shown up on the PEPr overview page as a
     draft. This stage is for you to play around with PEPr, to shape
     your proposal nicely and to prepare it for the proposal
     process. You can switch to the next stage whenever you want to
     publish your proposal and get feedback from the PEAR community.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="section" id="newmaint.proposal.step3.stage2"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Stage 2: Moving to the Proposal stage</h2></div>
    

    <p class="para">
     After switching to the stage Proposal you have a real proposal.
     Either through email or through PEPr itself the community will
     give you hints and ask questions about the proposed
     package. Generally it is a good idea to follow these suggestions,
     but sometimes people in the community will have different visions
     for your package, which should be sorted out during this
     stage. After a week of comments you may switch to the next
     phase. You should only switch to the next stage, if you are sure
     that the PEAR community will accept your package.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="section" id="newmaint.proposal.step3.stage3"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Stage 3: Calling for votes</h2></div>
    

    <p class="para">
     The next stage is the voting stage, during which you may not
     change your proposal anymore. You may not edit nor delete the
     proposal from now on. During the proposal stage,
     "<span class="quote">Call for Votes,</span>"
     every active PEAR maintainer may give one vote on the
     proposal. Votes are given using the numbers -1, 0 and +1, where
     -1 means "<span class="quote">I&#039;m against this package to be added to PEAR in the
     current form,</span>" +1 says
     "<span class="quote">I&#039;m in favor of getting this package
     into PEAR in the current form</span>" and 0 means
     "<span class="quote">I have looked at your
     package, but I am undecided.</span>" The time to vote for a package
     is 7 calendar days. If after this time less than
     5 votes have been cast, the developers get another 7 days to cast
     their votes. After this time the voting is ended, whether there
     are 5 votes or not.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Votes on proposals can be bound to a condition. These conditional
     votes indicate that you have to fulfill a certain condition the
     voters expect to be fulfilled. If there are conditional votes you
     are expected to read and follow them! The conditions on a vote
     will be provided in the votes comment. Each vote
     may have comments. Reading those is always
     a good idea!
    </p>

   <div class="section" id="newmaint.proposal.step3.stage4"><div class="info"><h2 class="title">Stage 4: Proposal Finished</h2></div>
    

    <p class="para">
     Now your proposal is finished. To determine if the proposal was
     successful or not, the sum of all votes is computed. If the
     result is greater or equal to 5 the proposal has been
     accepted. Otherwise we are sorry to say, that the community has
     decided to reject it. Have a look at their comments during
     proposal and vote stage to find out why. Maybe you can rework
     your package and propose it again, but please do not try to hand
     in a proposal the same way twice.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     If your proposal has been accepted, you may put your package into
     PEAR. If this is your first proposal, please contact the <a href="http://pear.php.net/group/" class="link external">PEAR Group</a> via email to get your
     current PEAR website account upgraded to a full featured developer
     account. After that, you can register your package and upload
     releases.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     The process of preparing and uploading a release is described in
     the <a href="guide-developers.html" class="link">Developer Guide</a>.
