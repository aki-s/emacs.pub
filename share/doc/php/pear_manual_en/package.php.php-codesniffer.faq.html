 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>Does PHP_CodeSniffer perform any code coverage or unit testing?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   No. PHP_CodeSniffer is not a tool for testing that your PHP application works correctly. All PHP_CodeSniffer will do is ensure your PHP code meets the standards that you are following.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>My code is fine! Why do I need PHP_CodeSniffer?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   Maybe you don&#039;t, but if you want to ensure you adhere to a set of coding standards, PHP_CodeSniffer is a quick and easy way to do that. PHP_CodeSniffer is a replacement for the more manual task of checking coding standards in code reviews. With PHP_CodeSniffer, you can reserve code reviews for the checking of code correctness.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="note">
   <span class="simpara">
    Coding standards are a good thing. They will make your code easier to read and maintain, especially when multiple developers are working on the same application. Consider using coding standards if you don&#039;t already.
   </span>
  </blockquote>

 </div>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>Does PHP_CodeSniffer parse my code to ensure it will execute?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   No. PHP_CodeSniffer does not actually parse your code, and so cannot accurately tell if your code contains parse errors. PHP_CodeSniffer does know about some parse errors and will warn you if it finds code that it is unable to sniff correctly due to a suspected parse error. However, as there is no actual parsing taking place, PHP_CodeSniffer may return an incorrect number of errors when checking code that does contain parse errors.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
   <p class="para">
    You can easily check for parse errors in a file using the PHP command line interface and the <code class="literal">-l</code> (lowercase L) option.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    </p><pre class="screen">
<br/>$&nbsp;php&nbsp;-l&nbsp;/path/to/code/myfile.inc<br/>No&nbsp;syntax&nbsp;errors&nbsp;detected&nbsp;in&nbsp;/path/to/code/myfile.inc<br/>
    </pre>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>I don&#039;t agree with your coding standards! Can I make PHP_CodeSniffer enforce my own?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   Yes. At its core, PHP_CodeSniffer is just a framework for enforcing coding standards. We release PHP_CodeSniffer with some sample coding standards to help developers get started on projects where there is no standard defined. If you want to write your own standard, read the <a href="package.php.php-codesniffer.coding-standard-tutorial.html" class="link">tutorial on creating coding standards</a>.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>How come PHP_CodeSniffer reported errors, I fixed them, now I get even more?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   Sometimes, errors mask the existence of other errors, or new errors are created as you fix others. For example, PHP_CodeSniffer might tell you that an inline IF statement needs to be defined with braces. Once you make this change, PHP_CodeSniffer may report that the braces you added are not correctly aligned.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Always run PHP_CodeSniffer until you get a passing result. Once you&#039;ve made the changes PHP_CodeSniffer recommends, run PHP_CodeSniffer again to ensure no new errors have been added.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>Why doesn&#039;t PHP_CodeSniffer just make the changes it suggests for me?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   As much as we trust PHP_CodeSniffer to check your code for coding standard errors, we don&#039;t trust any application to ever change code for us without reviewing it first. Considering you would have to check each change PHP_CodeSniffer made before releasing the source code, why not make the changes manually?
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Making the changes manually ensures a couple of positive things happen:
   </p><ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem">
     <p class="para">Developers learn the coding standards and make less mistakes in the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <p class="para">Developers can ensure that PHP_CodeSniffer is working correctly.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <p class="para">Developers can decide if a coding standard doesn&#039;t fit a particular piece of code.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  
  <p class="para">
   So if you find yourself wishing PHP_CodeSniffer would just go ahead and make those changes for you, maybe you just need to read the coding standards and adhere to them a bit better.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="note">
   <span class="simpara">
    No matter how small of a change you make, always test your code before committing it to your code repository or releasing it. Even changes suggested by PHP_CodeSniffer need to be tested, as small and insignificant as they may seem.
   </span>

 <div class="refsection"><div class="info"><h1>What does PHP_CodeSniffer use to tokenize my code?</h1>
</div>
  <p class="para">
   For PHP files, PHP_CodeSniffer uses <a href="http://www.php.net/tokenizer" class="link external">PHP&#039;s inbuilt tokenizer functions</a> to parse your code. It then changes that output to include much more data about the file, such as matching function braces to function keywords.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   For all other file types, PHP_CodeSniffer includes a custom tokenizer that either makes use of PHP&#039;s inbuilt tokenizer or emulates it. In both cases, the token array must be checked and changed manually before all the standard PHP_CodeSniffer matching rules are applied, making tokenizing a bit slower for these file types.
