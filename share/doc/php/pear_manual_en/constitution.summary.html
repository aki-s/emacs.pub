    The following summary of the constitution is only intended to clarify the most important
    features of the constitution.  The
    text starting with <a href="constitution.text.html" class="link">Constitution</a>
    is the official Constitution of PEAR.
   </p>

   <p class="para">
    Most importantly, this document&#039;s main purpose is to enable developers to
    innovate in a supportive environment, to foster good will between developers,
    to encourage best practices and to provide a clear path for resolving disputes.
    PEAR is about bringing PHP developers together to provide great solutions to
    the problems we encounter every day through the PHP language,
    it is ideal if the constitution is ancillary to the main activity at pear.php.net:
    coding.

    Developers have supreme power over ultimately what bugs/features will be
    assigned to specific roadmap versions, and to releasing package versions.
    Developers will have to cede some control over API
    decisions/QA/docs to the collective that contains their package.  Developers may be
    expected to mentor a new developer and help introduce them to the
    systems within PEAR (how to package, document, test, etc.)
   </p>
   </li>

   <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    In other words, the bulk of the day-to-day power will remain with
    developers, but some of the QA decisions and individual ownership will
    be relinquished to the collective that contains the package.
   </p>
   </li>

   <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Collectives have supreme power over packages within the collective
    in terms of API decisions, QA, documentation, defining the way
    collaboration works in the collective, choosing a collective leader or
    leaders, self-promotion of packages within the collective and assigning
    mentors to new developers of packages within the collective.
   </p>
   </li>

   <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    The PEAR Group only has power over issues that affect all of PEAR such as
    coding standards, SVN karma, and all major decisions made about PEAR as
    a whole.  For example, licenses allowed and what defines a collective are
    two issues that only the PEAR Group can resolve.
   </p>
   </li>

   <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    The PEAR president has no power over any of the things above, except for
    the ability to veto a PEAR Group decision.  The president cannot create
    policy.  The president&#039;s main job is public relations, talking to people outside
    of PEAR like an ambassador, trying to recruit new developers or bring
    packages into PEAR, and to solve big emergencies in a hurry such as finding
    a new hosting provider should the donated space for pear.php.net disappear.
