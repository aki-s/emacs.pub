 <p class="para">
  Versioning and stability are separate entities for
  <a href="guide.users.concepts.package.html" class="link">packages</a>.
  The stability of a package determines how likely the package is to contain bugs
  or to have changes to its <a href="guide.users.concepts.api.html" class="link">API</a>.
  A distinction is made between the version/stability of the API and the
  version/stability of the code.

      <td>
       The package is under development and will change dramatically, both
       adding new features, changing the design, and fixing many bugs.  It may
       not function at all and be more of a proof-of-concept.  There may be
       little to no documentation or unit tests.  Use at your own risk.

  <p class="para">
   There are a few conventions that should be followed when deciding which
   stability to use for your package.  In general, the API stability should be
   equal to or better than the release stability.
