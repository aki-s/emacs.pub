      <h2 class="title">How the initial members are chosen</h2>

      <p class="para">If there are more applicants than seats, there should be an open
      election, where everyone may cast as many votes as there are seats (only
      1 vote may be cast per candidate). Of course, if there are less people
      than seats, all may be accepted and the remaining seats can be filled by
      QA group vote. Once the core team is formed all further team members can
      be voted in as per the rules stated below.</p>

      <p class="para">There will be a QA core team with a limited number (no more than
      7, with the pear group this should give a sufficient amount of people
      with enough karma that can react to bad releases) people with extended
      &quot;core-QA-karma&quot;. In order for the QA core team to react quickly, the
      core QA team should be spread out across all time zones as good as
      possible. This rather small number should empower the QA team
      sufficiently to handle issues but doesn&#039;t trivialize access
      rights.</p>

      <blockquote class="note">
        <p class="para">This issue needs more discussion since Klaus raised a <a href="http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=26756" class="link external">good
        point in his post</a> but the problem is that it isn&#039;t wise to give
        many users so much karma.</p>
      </blockquote>


      <p class="para">All other people interested are free to join the QA team. However
      potential new members for the QA team (core and non core) must be voted
      in by a 2/3 majority of the existing members of the QA team (core and
      non core). This is to prevent that the addition of new members is done
      even though there is a considerable amount of opposition, as this could
      lead to internal quarrels which could result in reducing the QA teams
      ability to efficiently address QA issues. Removing a member from either
      group requires a 2/3 majority as well.</p>

      <p class="para">For casual helpers the QA mailing list will of course remain
      open.</p>

      <p class="para">All members of the QA team (core and non core) are eligible to
      participate in QA team votes.</p>

      <p class="para">Any member that leaves the QA team loses all his special karma
      which he may have received due to his membership. If any member of the
      core QA team leaves and as a result a time zone gets under staffed, QA
      should actively try to find a replacement.</p>

      <blockquote class="note">
        <p class="para">When voting for a new member voters must be sure that the person
        has been helping with bug fixes in the past or has the potentials to
        help with that.</p>
