         This document has been published on 14th November 2003 and
         describes how releases that break backwards compatibility (BC)
         have to be handled.
       </p>
     

     <p class="para">
       The goal is to make it possible to be able to run multiple major
       versions in one script.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
       For this reason new major versions (BC break or when the
       maintainer feels it makes sense as a result of dramatic feature
       additions or rewrites) require a new package using the following
       naming convention in the following order of preference (where
       &#039;Foo&#039; is the package name and &#039;X&#039; the major version number):
     </p>

     <ol type="1">
       <li class="listitem">
         <span class="simpara">FooX</span>
       </li>
       <li class="listitem">
         <span class="simpara">FoovX</span>
       </li>
       <li class="listitem">
         <span class="simpara">Foo_vX</span>
       </li>
     </ol>

     <p class="para">
       The choice should be made based on preventing current and future
       misleading or ambiguous names. This means good care should be
       taken in making the right choice for the package. Obviously the
       first two allow for some ambiguity (is DB2 a package for IBM&#039;s
       DB2 or just the major version 2 of DB? - is IPv4 a package for
       IPv4 or is it the 4th major release if IP?). They don&#039;t break the
       idea of &quot;_&quot; mapping to directories (the class DB_NestedSet
       implies that there is a nestedset.php in the DB dir). The last
       one prevents any ambiguity but it&#039;s the least visually pleasing
       and also breaks the &#039;_&#039; to directory mapping and is therefore the
       last choice.
     </p>

     <p class="para">
       We also came to the conclusion that the pear installer should not
       be clever about the relationship between two major releases aside
       from printing out notices about the fact that there is a newer
       major version when a user installs an earlier one. However all
       major versions of a package will be listed on one package
       home. This is especially important in order to not break
       tutorials that cover older major releases (tutorial xyz for major
       version 1 simply says &#039;pear install Foo&#039; - if the system would
       then install &#039;Foo2&#039; the user might be in for an unpleasant
       surprise).
     </p>

     <p class="para">
       Therefore, new major versions are for all intents and purposes
       new packages with the above mentioned exceptions. The names of
       these new packages are derived using one of the above mentioned
       naming conventions.
