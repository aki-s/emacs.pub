      <h2 class="title">What&#039;s changed?</h2>

      <p class="para">PHP5 Introduces PPP - Private, Public and Protected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.protected-members.info.protpriv">
      <h2 class="title">What&#039;s protected and private?</h2>

      <p class="para">Protected members can be accessed in classes extending the class
      they are declared in, where as private members can only be accessed by
      the class they belong to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.protected-members.info.previously">
      <h2 class="title">What did we use to do, and why?</h2>

      <p class="para">In PHP4, both private and protected members were prefixed with an
      underscore. This was to ensure the user of the class knew what methods
      were available to them, and not to mess with anything else.</p>

      <p class="para">One of the key reasons for prefixed members is the visual
      expression of &quot;Do not mess with this member, I may remove/rename it in
      the future&quot;. This is fine for private members, however will not follow
      for protected members when the class is extended by the user.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.protected-members.info.ignore">
      <h2 class="title">Is it possible to accidently ignore the declarations?</h2>

      <p class="para">If a member is declared as protected (using the protected
      keyword), an E_FATAL error will be thrown if the member is used
      incorrectly.</p>

      <p class="para">PHP5 will also provide errors if a user attempts to redeclare a
      protected var as private. However protected members may be declared
      public by child classes.</p>

      <p class="para">In this regard &#039;protected&#039; is like public in terms of the
      obligations of the library author. For example, if you want to keep your
      public API small, but allow extending classes to expose more
      functionality. Or, if you would prefer to access class properties
      directly rather than using setter methods, you can redeclare the
      properties public in a child class.</p>

      <p class="para">In these situations, public vars would be prefixed as
      &quot;private&quot;.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rfc.protected-members.info.readability">
      <h2 class="title">Does prefixing enhance readability?</h2>

      <p class="para">Some would argue yes, some would argue no. Most large classes
      consist almost completely of protected members, with the public members
      reserved for the API. In this situation, does having almost everything
      underscored really enhance readability?</p>

      <p class="para">Is private the same as protected? No, definitly not. Then why
      should it be prefixed the same? Some argue this actually decreases
      readability and confuses private members.</p>

      <p class="para">Is protected the same as public? No, definitly not. The user can&#039;t
      use a protected member (unless they are extending the class). In this
      example, protected has a lot more in common private. Should the user be
      protected visually (as well as with the language construct) from using
      protected members?</p>
