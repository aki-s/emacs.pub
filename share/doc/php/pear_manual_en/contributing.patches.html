   If you have modified a package to expand its functionality or to fix a
   bug, you should contribute your changes back to the community (some
   licenses force you to do so, and it is generally considered immoral not to).
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   Before creating the patch, you must first obtain the latest sources of the
   package you wish to patch from SVN by running the commands (the package
   in this example is Foo_Bar):
   </p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>
svn checkout http://svn.php.net:/repository/pear/packages/Foo_Bar/trunk
</code></strong>
   </pre>
<p>
   Now that you have the latest sources, you can edit the relevant file(s).
   Make sure that your patch is fully compatible with the PEAR <a href="standards.html" class="link">coding
standards</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   After you have finished adding/changing the code, TEST it: We will not
   accept code that hasn&#039;t been carefully tested.
   When you are absolutely sure the new code doesn&#039;t introduce bugs, create a
   unified diff by running:
   </p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>cd pear/Foo_Bar</code></strong>
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff &gt;Foo_Bar.diff</code></strong>
   </pre>
<p>
   The resulting .diff file contains your patch. This diff makes it easy
   for us to see what has been changed.
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   The next step is to submit the patch.

   There are basically two options to do this:
   The first option is to submit the patch by creating a bug report
   for the package in question.

   You can do this by visiting the package homepage on pear.php.net
   and clicking on the &quot;Bugs&quot; tab at the top of the page.

   Another option is sending a mail to pear-dev@lists.php.net
   and Cc&#039;ing the maintainer(s) of the package.

   The subject of the mail should be prefixed with &#039;[Patch]&#039;
   to make it clear you are submitting a patch.

   Also include a verbose explanation of what the patch does.

   Don&#039;t forget to attach the .diff file to the mail.

   The maintainers of the package are usually listed
   in the header of each source file.

   Apart from that their email addresses are available
   on the package information page on http://pear.php.net/.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
   <p class="para">
    If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express, please change the file
    extension of the diff file to .txt, because Outlook&#039;s MIME-Type
    detection depends on the file extension and attachments with a
    MIME-Type not equal to <code class="literal">text/plain</code> will be rejected
    by our mailinglist software.
   </p>
  </blockquote>


  <blockquote class="note">
   <p class="para">
    If your patch does break backwards compatibility, the chances are fairly
    good that the maintainers won&#039;t be happy about it.

    Thus you should always try to fix a bug in a way
    that does not seriously change the public API.

    But if there is absolutely no way to keep backwards compatibility and/or
    if your patch contains a groundbreaking improvement, even API changes are
    fine.
