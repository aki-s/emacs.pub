This is the location to house the images used for the printed book.
The book includes the core tutorial only, which is the getStarted, java,
essential, collections, and deployment trails. (As of the 5th edition.)

For these trails, for any diagrams created, we need a GIF image for the
online version of the diagram. But the publisher also needs an EPS version
for the printed book. When requesting images from the art department,
make sure to request both versions.

For any screenshots, we need a JPG image for the online version of the
screen shot at regular resolution. We need a high res TIF version for the
printed book.
