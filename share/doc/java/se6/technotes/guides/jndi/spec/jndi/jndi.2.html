<h2 class="chapter"><a name="pgfId=997857"></a>2. Goals and Design
Principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997858"></a>We followed several
principles and maxims in designing the API.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId=997859"></a>2.1 Keep it
consistent and intuitive</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997860"></a>Wherever possible, we
have used existing components from the rest of the Java development
environment. Adhering to this principle not only makes JNDI
consistent with existing core classes in the Java platform but also
reduces needless proliferation of classes.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997862"></a>The object-oriented
nature of the Java programming language allows for an intuitive and
simple API design, in which the directory service functionality is
expressed as a natural extension to the more fundamental naming
service functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId=997863"></a>2.2 Pay for what you
use</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997864"></a>The API is structured in
a tiered manner so that the application programmer interested in a
certain directory service capability need not necessarily know
about a more advanced capability. We have strived to keep the lower
tiers simple and also make them represent the common case
capability, relegating the more complex ones to the upper
tiers.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId=997865"></a>2.3 Implementable
over common directory and naming services and protocols</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997866"></a>This goal is important
for two reasons. First, it enables Java applications to take
advantage of information in a variety of existing naming and
directory services such as DNS, NDS, NIS (YP), X.500, and LDAP.
Second, it helps limit the appearance of any implementation
specific artifacts in the API.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997867"></a>Providing a unified
interface to multiple naming and directory services does not imply
that access of unique features of a particular service is
precluded. The unified API which is designed to cover the common
case is still beneficial to applications that have explicit
knowledge of the underlying naming or directory service. Such
applications still benefit from sharing the common portions that
use the API. This is analogous to applications sharing commonly
used classes and yet adding needed specificity via subclassing.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId=997868"></a>2.4 Seamless
integration</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997869"></a>This is important not
only because of the diversity of directory service and naming
services in the installed base that need to be supported, but also
because new Java application and service programmers can export
their own namespaces and directory objects in a uniform way.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=997870"></a>We also wanted to make a
variety of implementation choices possible without having the
application pay for this freedom. For example, a
&quot;thin-client&quot; might be better served by a proxy-style
protocol in which the access to specific naming and directory
services is relegated to a server. Whereas, a performance
sensitive, resource rich client, might choose to use an
implementation which directly allows it to access the various
servers. However, the application should be insulated from these
implementation choices. It should be possible to defer such choices
even until runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId=998702"></a>2.5 Support for
leading industry standards</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId=998703"></a>The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (Internet RFC 2251) has emerged as the
standard for directory access at the protocol level. All major
directory vendors have products that support this protocol. An
application that uses JNDI should be able to access all of the
features offered by this standard. Where possible, JNDI should
support conventions (such as those for specifying search
queries/filters) already defined by the standard.</p>
