<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What Is Java Plug-in?</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in extends the functionality of a web browser,
allowing applets or Java Beans to be run under Sun's Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) rather than the Java Runtime Environment that
comes with the web browser. Java Plug-in is part of Sun's JRE . It
is installed with the JRE on users computer. It works with
supported <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/system-configurations.html">
Mozilla</a> browsers and Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Browsers can run applets by invoking the Java Plug-in in two
different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By using the conventional <code>APPLET</code> tag in a web
page.</li>
<li>By replacing the <code>APPLET</code> tag with the
<code>OBJECT</code> tag for Internet Explorer; by replacing the
<code>APPLET</code> tag with the <code>EMBED</code> tag for
supported Mozilla browsers. Note, however, that the
<code>OBJECT</code> and <code>EMBED</code> tags must conform to a
special format as described in the next chapter, <i><a href=
"using_tags.html">Using OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET Tags in Java
Plug-in</a></i>.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>OBJECT</code> and <code>EMBED</code> tags can be manually
updated in web pages.</p>
<p>While the above constitutes the heart of Java Plug-in, there are
many other related topics that you may want to understand. For
instance, you may want to know how proxy configuration works in
Java Plug-in, you may want to know what protocols Java Plug-in
supports, or you may want to know about cookie support and caching.
Such topics are included in <i>Part I: Java Plug-in Basics</i>.</p>
<p>You can determine some of the behavior of Java Plug-in and set
options via the Java Control Panel. How you do this is also
discussed in Part I in the chapter called <i>Using the Java Control
Panel to Set Plug-in Behavior/Options</i>.</p>
<p>Java Plug-in may be deployed in various ways—on the Internet,
within an intranet, via Java Server Pages, etc. The various types
and methods of deployments are discussed in the <i>Part II:
Deployment Schemes</i>.</p>
<p>Applets must be run in a secure environment, and various
security topics are discussed in the <i>Part III: Security</i>,
including RSA signed applet verification. As signing applets can be
a difficult topic for novice applet developers, this guide provides
step-by-step instructions for signing applets in the chapter called
<a href="rsa_signing.html">Signing Applets Using RSA-Signed
Certificates</a>.</p>
<p>Java Plug-in provides various kinds of debugging support for
applets, and <i>Part IV: Debugging Support</i> describes them. Java
Debugger support is discussed. So is the Java Plug-in Console,
which includes various options that may be set for debugging,
including ones for tracing and logging.</p>
<p><i>Part V: Advanced Topics</i> discusses more esoteric matters
such as supporting multiple JREs in the same environment,
Java-toJavaScript communication, how to persist applets across
browser sessions, special applet attributes for changing the applet
window background color, etc.</p>
<p><i>Appendices</i> provide information about supported Mozilla
browsers, an FAQ, information about the HTML Converter, and
Microsoft VM versus Java SE compatibility issues.</p>

Systems and Browsers</h2>
