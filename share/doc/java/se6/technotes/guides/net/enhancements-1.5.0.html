testing for the reachability of a host. This features provides a

containers can provide Cookie management by implementing the new
<code>CookieHandler</code> API. (4696506)</li>
<li>Proxy server configuration has been improved. It can now be
dynamic and controlable by web containers and applications through
the <code>ProxySelector</code> API, which can also handle failures
to connect to the proxy. (4696512)</li>
<li>A new framework provides a way for protocol handlers to access
a file caching mechanism implemented by the platform or by a third
party. (4837267)</li>
