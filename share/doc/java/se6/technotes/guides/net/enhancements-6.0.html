<h3>Enhancement to NetworkInterface</h3>
<blockquote>Provides a number of new methods for accessing state
and configuration information relating to a system's network
adapters. This includes information such as the broadcast address,
subnet mask, MAC addresses, and MTU size. See <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html">java.net.NetworkInterface</a>
<p>The new class <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/InterfaceAddress.html">java.net.InterfaceAddress</a>
encapsulates all information about a NetworkInterface's IP
addresses, including the broadcast address, and subnet prefix
length (subnet mask)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Support for Internationalized Domain Names</h3>
<blockquote>RFCs 3490, 3491, 3492, 3454 define a mechanism where
domain names comprised of characters in alphabets other than US
ASCII can be stored in the DNS. An algorithm is defined which
provides a conversion from arbitrary Unicode strings to and from a
"mangled" ASCII form. This feature provides a new class <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/IDN.html">java.net.IDN</a>, which allows
applications to do this conversion so that IDNs can be looked up
via <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/InetAddress.html">java.net.InetAddress</a>.</blockquote>
<h3>HTTP Negotiate authentication</h3>
<blockquote>This adds support for the "Negotiate" HTTP
authentication scheme defined by Microsoft. Negotiate allows
multiple underlying authentication mechanisms to be supported, and
in each instance, one of these mechanisms is chosen for use.
Currently, Kerberos is the only supported mechanism. This feature
is described in more detail in the guide to <a href=
"http-auth.html">Http Authentication</a>.</blockquote>
<h3>Cross platform NTLM</h3>
<blockquote>Previously, the Microsoft defined NTLM authentication
protocol for HTTP was only supported on Windows. Now, this protocol
is supported on all platforms.</blockquote>
<h3>Default CookieManager implementation</h3>
<blockquote>The CookieHandler class was added in 1.5, but no
implementation was provided in java.net. This feature provides a
simple extensible implementation which separates the storage of
cookies from the policy surrounding their acceptance. The default
manager provides a number of standard policies and a simple
in-memory storage mechanism. User defined policies and storage
mechanisms can be used with this implementation. The following are
the new classes related to this feature:
<ul>
<li><a href=
"../../../api/java/net/CookieManager.html">java.net.CookieManager</a></li>
<li><a href=
"../../../api/java/net/CookiePolicy.html">java.net.CookiePolicy</a></li>
<li><a href=
"../../../api/java/net/CookieStore.html">java.net.CookieStore</a></li>
<li><a href=
"../../../api/java/net/HttpCookie.html">java.net.HttpCookie</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Light-weight HTTP server</h3>
<blockquote>This provides a simple set of classes and interfaces
for building light-weight HTTP server applications. The feature
defines <a href=
"../../../jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/index.html">two new
packages</a> com.sun.net.httpserver and com.sun.net.httpserver.spi.
The server supports HTTP and HTTPS.</blockquote>
