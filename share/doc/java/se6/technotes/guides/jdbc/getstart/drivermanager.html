<h3>3.1 DriverManager Overview</h3>
<p><a name="997394"></a> The <code>DriverManager</code> class is
the traditional management layer of JDBC, working between the user
and the drivers. It keeps track of the drivers that are available
and handles establishing a connection between a database and the
appropriate driver. In addition, the <code>DriverManager</code>
class attends to things like driver login time limits and the
printing of log and tracing messages.</p>
<p><a name="1002968"></a> Note that the <code>javax.sql</code>
package, otherwise known as the JDBC 2.0 Standard Extension API,
provides the <code>DataSource</code> interface as an alternate and
preferred means of connecting to a data source. However, the
<code>DriverManager</code> facility can still be used with drivers
that support <code>DataSource</code> implementations.</p>
<p><a name="998476"></a> For simple applications, the only method
in the <code>DriverManager</code> class that a general programmer
needs to use directly is <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>.
As its name implies, this method establishes a connection to a
database. An application may call the <code>DriverManager</code>
methods <code>getDriver</code>, <code>getDrivers</code>, and
<code>registerDriver</code> as well as the <code>Driver</code>
method <code>connect</code>, but in most cases it is better to let
the <code>DriverManager</code> class manage the details of
establishing a connection.</p>
<a name="997322"></a>
<h4>3.1.1 Keeping Track of Available Drivers</h4>
<p><a name="999681"></a> The <code>DriverManager</code> class
maintains a list of <code>Driver</code> classes that have
registered themselves by calling the method
<code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code>. All <code>Driver</code>
classes should be written with a static section (a static
initializer) that creates an instance of the class and then
registers it with the <code>DriverManager</code> class when it is
loaded. Thus, a user would not normally call
<code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code> directly; it should be
called automatically by a <code>Driver</code> class when it is
loaded. A <code>Driver</code> class is loaded, and therefore
automatically registered with the <code>DriverManager</code>, in
one of two ways:</p>
<p><a name="1002784"></a></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="997324"></a></li>
<li>by calling the method <code>Class.forName</code>. This
explicitly loads the driver class. Since it does not depend on any
external setup, this way of loading a driver is the recommended one
for using the <code>DriverManager</code> framework. The following
code loads the class <code>acme.db.Driver</code>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Class.forName("acme.db.Driver");
</pre></blockquote>
<a name="997365"></a>
<p>If <code>acme.db.Driver</code> has been written so that loading
it causes an instance to be created and also calls
<code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code> with that instance as the
parameter (as it should do), then it is in the
<code>DriverManager</code>'s list of drivers and available for
creating a connection. <a name="1002774"></a></p>
<a name="1002777"></a></li>
<li>by adding the <code>Driver</code> class to the
<code>java.lang.System</code> property <code>jdbc.drivers</code>.
This is a list of driver classnames, separated by colons, that the
<code>DriverManager</code> class loads. When the
<code>DriverManager</code> class is initialized, it looks for the
system property "<code>jdbc.drivers</code>," and if the user has
entered one or more drivers, the <code>DriverManager</code> class
attempts to load them. The following code illustrates how a
programmer might enter three driver classes in
~/.hotjava/properties (HotJava loads these into the system
properties list on startup):</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<pre>
jdbc.drivers=foo.bah.Driver:wombat.sql.Driver:bad.test.ourDriver
</pre></blockquote>
<a name="998646"></a>
<blockquote>The first call to a <code>DriverManager</code> method
will automatically cause these driver classes to be
loaded.</blockquote>
<a name="1001916"></a>
<p><a name="999830"></a> Note that this second way of loading
drivers requires a preset environment that is persistent. If there
is any doubt about that being the case, it is safer to call the
method <code>Class.forName</code> to explicitly load each driver.
This is also the right method to use to bring in a particular
driver since once the <code>DriverManager</code> class has been
initialized, it will never recheck the <code>jdbc.drivers</code>
property list.</p>
<p><a name="999831"></a> In both of these cases, it is the
responsibility of the newly-loaded <code>Driver</code> class to
register itself by calling
<code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code>. As mentioned, this
should be done automatically when the class is loaded.</p>
<p><a name="997331"></a> For security reasons, the JDBC management
layer will keep track of which class loader provided which driver.
Then when the <code>DriverManager</code> class is opening a
connection, it will use only drivers that come from the local file
system or from the same class loader as the code issuing the
request for a connection.</p>
<a name="997332"></a>
<h4>3.1.2 Establishing a Connection</h4>
<p><a name="1002712"></a> Once the <code>Driver</code> classes have
been loaded and registered with the <code>DriverManager</code>
class, they are available for establishing a connection with a
database. When a request for a connection is made with a call to
the <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> method, the
<code>DriverManager</code> tests each driver in turn to see if it
can establish a connection.</p>
<p><a name="998421"></a> It may sometimes be the case that more
than one JDBC driver is capable of connecting to a given URL. For
example, when connecting to a given remote database, it might be
possible to use a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, a
JDBC-to-generic-network-protocol driver, or a driver supplied by
the database vendor. In such cases, the order in which the drivers
are tested is significant because the <code>DriverManager</code>
will use the first driver it finds that can successfully connect to
the given URL.</p>
<p><a name="998900"></a> First the <code>DriverManager</code> tries
to use each driver in the order it was registered. (The drivers
listed in <code>jdbc.drivers</code> are always registered first.)
It will skip any drivers that are untrusted code unless they have
been loaded from the same source as the code that is trying to open
the connection.</p>
<p><a name="998422"></a> It tests the drivers by calling the method
<code>Driver.connect</code> on each one in turn, passing them the
URL that the user originally passed to the method
<code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>. The first driver that
recognizes the URL makes the connection.</p>
<p><a name="998441"></a> At first glance this may seem inefficient,
but it requires only a few procedure calls and string comparisons
per connection since it is unlikely that dozens of drivers will be
loaded concurrently.</p>
<p><a name="998390"></a> The following code is an example of all
that is normally needed to set up a connection with a driver such
as a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Class.forName("jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"); //loads the driver
String url = "jdbc:odbc:fred";
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
                url, "userID", "passwd");
</pre></blockquote>
<p><a name="999926"></a> The variable con represents a connection
to the data source "fred" that can be used to create and execute
SQL statements.</p>
<p><a name="1001917"></a> With the addition of the JDBC 2.0
Standard Extension API, a <code>DataSource</code> object can be
used to establish a connection with a data source. The
<code>DriverManager</code> can still be used, but a
<code>DataSource</code> object offers several advantages over the
<code>DriverManager</code> and is the preferred alternative.
Developers who are writing Enterprise JavaBeans components,
however, should always use a <code>DataSource</code> object instead
of the <code>DriverManager</code>. Using a properly implemented
<code>DataSource</code> object is the only way to get connections
that are pooled and that can participate in distributed
transactions.</p>
<a name="999927"></a>
<h4>3.1.3 DriverManager Methods Are Static</h4>
<p><a name="999928"></a> All <code>DriverManager</code> methods are
declared <code>static</code>, which means that they operate on the
class as a whole and not on particular instances. In fact, the
constructor for <code>DriverManager</code> is declared
<code>private</code> to prevent users from instantiating it.
Logically, there is one instance of the <code>DriverManager</code>
class. This means that methods are called by qualifying them with
<code>DriverManager</code>, as in the following line of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
DriverManager.setLogWriter(out);
</pre></blockquote>
