<h3>Introduction</h3>
The Java 2 platform includes a <i>collections framework</i>. A
<i>collection</i> is an object that represents a group of objects
(such as the classic <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/Vector.html">Vector</a> class). A
collections framework is a unified architecture for representing
and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated
independently of the details of their representation.
<p>The primary advantages of a collections framework are that
it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces programming effort</strong> by providing useful
data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them
yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Increases performance</strong> by providing
high-performance implementations of useful data structures and
algorithms. Because the various implementations of each interface
are interchangeable, programs can be easily tuned by switching
implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Provides interoperability between unrelated
APIs</strong> by establishing a common language to pass collections
back and forth.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces the effort required to learn APIs</strong> by
eliminating the need to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces the effort required to design and implement
APIs</strong> by eliminating the need to produce ad hoc collections
APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Fosters software reuse</strong> by providing a standard
interface for collections and algorithms to manipulate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The collections framework consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection Interfaces</strong> - Represent different
types of collections, such as sets, lists and maps. These
interfaces form the basis of the framework.</li>
<li><strong>General-purpose Implementations</strong> - Primary
implementations of the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Implementations</strong> - The collection
classes from earlier releases, <tt>Vector</tt> and
<tt>Hashtable</tt>, have been retrofitted to implement the
collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Special-purpose Implementations</strong> -
Implementations designed for use in special situations. These
implementations display nonstandard performance characteristics,
usage restrictions, or behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent Implementations</strong> - Implementations
designed for highly concurrent use.</li>
<li><strong>Wrapper Implementations</strong> - Add functionality,
such as synchronization, to other implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience Implementations</strong> - High-performance
"mini-implementations" of the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Implementations</strong> - Partial
implementations of the collection interfaces to facilitate custom
implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> - Static methods that perform
useful functions on collections, such as sorting a list.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> - Interfaces that provide
essential support for the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Array Utilities</strong> - Utility functions for arrays
of primitives and reference objects. Not, strictly speaking, a part
of the Collections Framework, this functionality was added to the
Java platform at the same time and relies on some of the same
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collection Interfaces</h3>
There are fourteen <i>collection interfaces</i>. The most basic
interface is <tt>Collection</tt>. These interfaces extend
<tt>Collection</tt>: <tt>Set</tt>, <tt>List</tt>,
<tt>SortedSet</tt>, <tt>NavigableSet</tt>, <tt>Queue</tt>,
<tt>Deque</tt>, <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> and <tt>BlockingDeque</tt>.
The other collection interfaces, <tt>Map</tt>, <tt>SortedMap</tt>,
<tt>NavigableMap</tt>, <tt>ConcurrentMap</tt> and
<tt>ConcurrentNavigableMap</tt> do not extend <tt>Collection</tt>,
as they represent mappings rather than true collections. However,
these interfaces contain <i>collection-view</i> operations, which
allow them to be manipulated as collections.
<p>Many of the modification methods in the collection interfaces
are labeled <i>optional</i>. Some implementations may not perform
one or more of these operations, throwing a runtime exception
(<tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>) if they are attempted.
Implementations must specify in their documentation which optional
operations they support. Several terms are introduced to aid in
this specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collections that do not support any modification operations
(such as <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt> and <tt>clear</tt>) are
referred to as <i>unmodifiable</i>. Collections that are not
unmodifiable are referred to <i>modifiable.</i></li>
<li>Collections that additionally guarantee that no change in the
<tt>Collection</tt> object will ever be visible are referred to as
<i>immutable</i>. Collections that are not immutable are referred
to as <i>mutable</i>.</li>
<li>Lists that guarantee that their size remains constant even
though the elements may change are referred to as
<i>fixed-size</i>. Lists that are not fixed-size are referred to as
<i>variable-size</i>.</li>
<li>Lists that support fast (generally constant time) indexed
element access are known as <i>random access</i> lists. Lists that
do not support fast indexed element access are known as
<i>sequential access</i> lists. The <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a></tt>
marker interface is provided to allow lists to advertise the fact
that they support random access. This allows generic algorithms to
alter their behavior to provide good performance when applied to
either random or sequential access lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some implementations may restrict what elements (or in the case
of <tt>Maps</tt>, keys and values) may be stored. Possible
restrictions include requiring elements to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be of a particular type.</li>
<li>Be non-<tt>null</tt>.</li>
<li>Obey some arbitrary predicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempting to add an element that violates an implementation's
restrictions results in a runtime exception, typically a
<tt>ClassCastException</tt>, an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>
or a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>. Attempting to remove or test
for the presence of an element that violates an implementation's
restrictions may result in an exception, though some "restricted
collections" may permit this usage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Collection Implementations</h3>
Classes that implement the collection interfaces typically have
names of the form
&lt;<em>Implementation-style</em>&gt;&lt;<em>Interface</em>&gt;.
The general purpose implementations are summarized in the table
below:<br />

<p>The general-purpose implementations support all of the
<i>optional operations</i> in the collection interfaces, and have
no restrictions on the elements they may contain. They are
unsynchronized, but the <tt>Collections</tt> class contains static
factories called <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedCollection(java.util.Collection)">
<em>synchronization wrappers</em></a> that may be used to add
synchronization to many unsynchronized collections. All of the new
implementations have <i>fail-fast iterators</i>, which detect
illegal concurrent modification, and fail quickly and cleanly
(rather than behaving erratically).</p>
<p>The <tt>AbstractCollection</tt>, <tt>AbstractSet</tt>,
<tt>AbstractList</tt>, <tt>AbstractSequentialList</tt> and
<tt>AbstractMap</tt> classes provide skeletal implementations of
the core collection interfaces, to minimize the effort required to
implement them. The API documentation for these classes describes
precisely how each method is implemented so the implementer knows
which methods should be overridden, given the performance of the
"basic operations" of a specific implementation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>The main design goal was to produce an API that was reasonably
small, both in size, and, more importantly, in &quot;conceptual
weight.&quot; It was critical that the new functionality not seem
alien to current Java programmers; it had to augment current
facilities, rather than replacing them. At the same time, the new
API had to be powerful enough to provide all the advantages
described above.</p>
<p>To keep the number of core interfaces small, the interfaces do
not attempt to capture such subtle distinctions as mutability,
modifiability, and resizability. Instead, certain calls in the core
interfaces are <i>optional</i>, allowing implementations to throw
an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> to indicate that they do
not support a specified optional operation. Of course, collection
implementers must clearly document which optional operations are
supported by an implementation.</p>
<p>To keep the number of methods in each core interface small, an
interface contains a method only if either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a truly <i>fundamental operation</i>: a basic operations
in terms of which others could be reasonably defined,</li>
<li>There is a compelling performance reason why an important
implementation would want to override it.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was critical that all reasonable representations of
collections interoperate well. This included arrays, which cannot
be made to implement the <tt>Collection</tt> interface directly
without changing the language. Thus, the framework includes methods
to allow collections to be dumped into arrays, arrays to be viewed
as collections, and maps to be viewed as collections.</p>
