<h2><a name="policy" id="policy"></a>Policy Files and
Permissions</h2>
<p>Java applications and applets deployed using Java Web Start and
Java Plug-in are by default run in a secure sandbox that defines
the set of permissions that code in an untrusted app is
granted.</p>
<p>The standard java policy files can be used to enhance the
permissions granted to untrusted apps. In addition to
<code>$JRE_HOME/lib/security/java.policy</code> and
<code>$USER_HOME/.java.policy</code> (used by all java programs),
applications and applets loaded by Java Web Start and Java Plug-in
load two additional policy files, whose location can be configured
by the deployment configuration properties:
<code>deployment.user.security.policy</code> and
<code>deployment.system.security.policy</code>.</p>
<p>The default sandbox, combined with the permissions granted by
these policy files, if they exist, determine the permissions
granted to untrusted code.</p>
<p>One other policy file, whose location is determined by the
deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.security.trusted.policy</code>, can be used to
restrict the permissions granted to trusted code. With this
property unset (default), trusted code will be granted the
<code>AllPermission</code> permission. With this property set,
trusted code will be granted only the permissions granted to
untrusted code, plus any other permissions granted by the policy
file pointed to by this property.</p>
<h2><a name="property" id="property"></a>Property Files and
Certificates</h2>
<p>The deployment configuration also has several properties that
determine how and if code can be trusted. Normally, any signed JAR
file in Java Plug-in, and any set of signed JAR files in Java Web
Start that are listed in a jnlp file requesting the
<code>AllPermission</code> permission, will be granted trust by the
user after the certificate chains have been verified and shown to
the user in a security dialog.</p>
<p>The deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.user.security.trusted.certs</code> points to a
certificate store that contains the certificates already accepted
by the user.</p>
<p>The deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.system.security.trusted.certs</code> can be
configured to point to a certificate store of certificates
pre-accepted by the system administrator.</p>
<p>If a JAR file (in Java Plug-in) or set of JAR files in a jnlp
file requesting the <code>AllPermission</code> permission (in Java
Web Start) is signed by a certificate that is in one of these
stores, it will be trusted.</p>
<p>The deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show</code> can control if
the user is permitted to grant trust to new code signed with new
certificates, and the deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.notinca</code> can further
be used to control if the user is permitted to grant trust to code
signed by certificates whose root certificate is not in one of the
Root Certificate Authority certificate stores (see below).</p>
<h2><a name="dialogs" id="dialogs"></a>Security Dialogs</h2>
<p>If the above two properties allow it, and the code is signed
with certificate chains that can be properly validated, the user
will then be shown a security dialog asking him/her to grant trust
to the code.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/warning_example_1.gif" width=
"521" height="359" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Run</strong> and the following dialog appears.</p>
<p align="center"><img src=
"images/warning_notinca_warning_true.gif" width="396" height=
"361" /></p>
<p>The Root Certificate Authority certificate stores mentioned
above are the union of the certificate stores in the files pointed
to by the properties: <code>deployment.user.security.cacerts</code>
and <code>deployment.system.security.cacerts</code>. By default
<code>deployment.system.security.cacerts</code> points to the
<code>cacerts</code> file in the <code>jre/lib/security</code>
directory. <code>deployment.user.security.cacerts</code> points to
a file that contains any additional <code>cacerts</code> imported
into it using the Certificates dialog in the Security tab of the
Java Control Panel.</p>
<p>One final setting can be used to customize the user experience
in Java Web Start. By default the sandbox does not include the
<code>AWTPermission</code>
<code>showWindowWithoutWarningBanner</code>. Without this
permission, all top-level windows will contain the awt banner
&quot;Java Application Window&quot; or &quot;Java Applet
Window&quot;. The deployment configuration property
<code>deployment.security.sandbox.awtwarningwindow</code> can be
used to add this permission to untrusted code.</p>
