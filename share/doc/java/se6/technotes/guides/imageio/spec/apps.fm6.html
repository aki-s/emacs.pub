<h2><a name="997067"><i>3.6</i> Transcoding</a></h2>
<blockquote><a name="998285"><!-- --></a> Transcoding refers to
reading an image file with a reader plug-in, and writing out the
image using a writer plug-in, especially, if the writer plug-in
cannot directly understand the native metadata format of the
reader. In such a case, there will always be some loss of
information, even if both plug-ins deal with the same file format.
A transcoder plug-in is responsible for converting the stream and
image metadata that have been created by a reader plug-in into a
better form for use by a writer plug-in. The API does not mandate
the presence of any transcoder plug-ins, but they may be installed
and registered just like readers and writers.
<p><a name="998289"><!-- --></a> A set of reader and writer
plug-ins may be designed to interpret each other&#39;s metadata
without the need for a separate transcoder. The relationships
between plug-ins can be determined using the
<code>ImageReaderSpi.getImageWriterSpiNames</code> and
<code>ImageWriterSpi.getImageReaderSpiNames</code> methods, which
indicate which plug-ins are known to work well with a given plug-in
of the opposite type. If multiple plug-ins are being written by a
single vendor, this mechanism will provide the best quality.</p>
<p><a name="998283"><!-- --></a> However, when working with
plug-ins that have not been designed to interoperate, a transcoder
plug-in may be provided by a developer who understands the metadata
formats of a given pair of reader and writer plug-ins, even though
each was written without knowledge of the other.</p>
<p><a name="998304"><!-- --></a> Given a particular pair of reader
and writer plug-ins, the set of appropriate transcoder plug-ins may
be located as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
ImageReader reader;
ImageWriter writer;

Iterator transcoders = ImageIO.getImageTranscoders(reader, writer);
