<h2>Java Accessibility API</h2>
<blockquote>The Java Accessibility API (JAAPI) is one of the core
parts of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). The JFC are a
comprehensive set of graphical user interface components and
foundation services designed to simplify deployment of Internet,
intranet and desktop applications. The JAAPI makes GUI component
information available to assistive technologies, giving users
alternative presentation and control of Java
applications.</blockquote>
<h2>Java Accessibility Utilities</h2>
<blockquote>The <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/jaccess-1.3/doc/index.html">Java
Accessibility Utilities</a> help assistive technologies take
advantage of the Java Accessibility API. The Utilities monitor
events related to UI components. They also help assistive
technologies get additional information about a GUI, such as the
current position of the mouse, or the window that currently has
focus.
<p>The Utilities are released separately from the JFC, but they can
be downloaded from the <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.jsp">JFC Home Page</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Pluggable Look and Feel</h2>
<blockquote>The Java Foundation Classes implement a Pluggable Look
and Feel architecture. This architecture allows non-visual
manifestations of a user interface to replace or enhance the visual
presentation of an application. The expression of the user
interface is separated from the underlying structure and data of
each individual component. This is accomplished by separating the
user interface of the component from its model. The model of a
component is the structure which encapsulates the state and
information that is presented to the user by the user interface.
More information on this architecture can be found in <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/">The Swing
Connection</a>.</blockquote>
