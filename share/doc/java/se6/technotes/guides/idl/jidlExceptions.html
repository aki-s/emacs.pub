<p>CORBA has two types of exceptions: standard system exceptions
which are fully specified by the OMG and user exceptions which are
defined by the individual application programmer. CORBA exceptions
are a little different from Java exception objects, but those
differences are largely handled in the mapping from IDL to
Java.</p>

<!--*********************DIFFERENCES****************-->
<h2><a name="differences" id="differences">Differences Between
CORBA and Java Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>To specify an exception in IDL, the interface designer uses the
<em>raises</em> keyword. This is similar to the <em>throws</em>
specification in Java. When you use the exception keyword in IDL
you create a user-defined exception. The standard system exceptions
need not (and cannot) be specified this way. 
<!--****************SYSTEM EXCEPTIONS***************--></p>
<h2><a name="systemexceptions" id="systemexceptions">System
Exceptions</a></h2>
CORBA defines a set of standard system exceptions, which are
generally raised by the ORB libraries to signal systemic error
conditions like:
<ul>
<li>Server-side system exceptions, such as resource exhaustion or
activation failure.</li>
<li>Communication system exceptions, for example, losing contact
with the object, host down, or cannot talk to ORB daemon
(orbd).</li>
<li>Client-side system exceptions, such as invalid operand type or
anything that occurs before a request is sent or after the result
comes back.</li>
</ul>
<p>All IDL operations can throw system exceptions when invoked. The
interface designer need not specify anything to enable operations
in the interface to throw system exceptions -- the capability is
automatic.</p>
<p>This makes sense because no matter how trivial an operation's
implementation is, the potential of an operation invocation coming
from a client that is in another process, and perhaps (likely) on
another machine, means that a whole range of errors is
possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, a CORBA client should always catch CORBA system
exceptions. Moreover, developers cannot rely on the Java compiler
to notify them of a system exception they should catch, because
CORBA system exceptions are descendants of
<tt>java.lang.RuntimeException</tt>.</p>
<h3><a name="structure" id="structure">System Exception
Structure</a></h3>
<p>All CORBA system exceptions have the same structure:</p>
<pre>
exception &lt;SystemExceptionName&gt; { // descriptive of error
    unsigned long <a href=
"#minorcodes">minor</a>;          // more detail about error
    CompletionStatus <a href=
"#compstatus">completed</a>;   // yes, no, maybe
}
&nbsp;
</pre>
<p>System exceptions are subtypes of
<tt>java.lang.RuntimeException</tt> through
<tt>org.omg.CORBA.SystemException</tt>:</p>
<pre>
java.lang.Exception
 |
 +--java.lang.RuntimeException
     |
     +--org.omg.CORBA.SystemException
         |
         +--BAD_PARAM
         |
         +--//etc. 
&nbsp;
</pre>
<h3><a name="minorcodes" id="minorcodes">Minor Codes</a></h3>
<p>All CORBA system exceptions have a minor code field, a number
that provides additional information about the nature of the
failure that caused the exception. Minor code meanings are not
specified by the OMG; each ORB vendor specifies appropriate minor
codes for that implementation. For the meaning of minor codes
thrown by the Java&nbsp; ORB, see <a href=
"#minorcodemeanings">Minor code meanings</a> .</p>
<h3><a name="compstatus" id="compstatus">Completion Status</a></h3>
<p>All CORBA system exceptions have a completion status field,
indicating the status of the operation that threw the exception.
The completion codes are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>COMPLETED_YES</dt>
<dd>The object implementation has completed processing prior to the
exception being raised.</dd>
<dt>COMPLETED_NO</dt>
<dd>The object implementation was not invoked prior to the
exception being raised.</dd>
<dt>COMPLETED_MAYBE</dt>
<dd>The status of the invocation is unknown.</dd>
</dl>
<!--****************USER EXCEPTIONS***************-->
<h2><a name="userexceptions" id="userexceptions">User
Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>CORBA user exceptions are subtypes of
<tt>java.lang.Exception</tt> through
<tt>org.omg.CORBA.UserException</tt>:</p>
<pre>
java.lang.Exception
 |
 +--org.omg.CORBA.UserException
      |
      +-- Stocks.BadSymbol
      |
      +--//etc. 
</pre>
<p>Each user-defined exception specified in IDL results in a
generated Java exception class. These exceptions are entirely
defined and implemented by the programmer 
<!--*****************MINOR CODE MEANINGS********************--></p>
<h2><a name="minorcodemeanings" id="minorcodemeanings">Minor Code
Meanings</a></h2>
<p>System exceptions all have a field <i>minor</i> that allows
CORBA vendors to provide additional information about the cause of
the exception. For a list of standard OMG minor code exceptions
(OMGVMCID), refer to the OMG document at <a href=
"http://www.omg.org/docs/omg/03-01-04.txt">http://www.omg.org/docs/omg/03-01-04.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the most common Sun minor code exceptions are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COMM_FAILURE/201</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
201</em> literally means "CONNECT_FAILURE". This may be caused by a
<code>java.net.SocketException</code>, usually one of
<code>BindException</code>, <code>ConnectException</code>, or
<code>NoRouteToHostException</code>.
<p>Some things to verify are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a naming service running? If not, start the ORBD naming
service as described in the document <a href=
"../../tools/share/orbd.html#starting">Starting and Stopping
ORBD</a>.</li>
<li>Are the <code>-ORBInitialHost</code> and
<code>-ORBInitialPort</code> values being set correctly for the
naming service? If you are uncertain about what the settings should
be, read the document <a href=
"../../tools/share/orbd.html#starting">Starting and Stopping
ORBD</a>.</li>
<li>Are the client and server applications aware of the port number
(and machine name, if applicable) where the Naming Service is
running? Read <a href=
"../../tools/share/orbd.html#starting">Starting and Stopping
ORBD</a> for more information on how to do this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>COMM_FAILURE/208</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
208</em> literally means "CONNECTION ABORT", which generally means
the connection has been dropped.</li>
<li><strong>COMM_FAILURE/209</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
209</em> literally means "CREATE_LISTENER_FAILED": <code>Unable to
create the listener thread on the specific port. Either the post is
taken or there was an error creating the daemon thread</code>. This
generally indicates that the port on which you are trying to run
the naming service is in use by another process. If you are running
on Solaris, you could discover whether or not something is running
on this port using the following terminal prompt command:
<pre>
netstat | grep <em>port_number</em>
</pre></li>
<li><strong>OBJECT_NOT_EXIST/204</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor
code: 204</em> literally means "SERVANT_NOT_FOUND". It is only
thrown in one place:
<code>corba.INSSubcontract.getINSReference</code>.</li>
<li><strong>MARSHAL/217</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
217</em> means that your client tried to send either a
<code>wchar</code> or <code>wstring</code> in GIOP 1.0, which is
not legal in the spec.</li>
<li><strong>MARSHAL/202</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
202</em> means that the code is attempting to marshal an object
that derives from <code>org.omg.CORBA.Object</code>, but that
particular instance has never been connected to an ORB. When using
the POA, you need to register the object with the POA first. If you
need more information on how to register an object with the POA,
refer to the <a href="POA.html">POA</a> document or the <a href=
"GShome.html">tutorial</a>.</li>
<li><strong>BAD_PARAM/201</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor code:
201</em> literally means "NULL_PARAM". This exception often occurs
because a Java <code>null</code> was given to a <code>write</code>
method such as <code>write_string</code>,
<code>write_octet_array</code>, etc. You cannot return a Java
<code>null</code> as the result of a Java method.</li>
<li><strong>org.omg.CORBA.INTERNAL</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN minor
code: 208</em> means <code>Unable to determine local hostname using
InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code>.
<p>The ORB uses
<code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> to create a
reference to the name service for looking for and/or binding
references. It also uses
<code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> on the server
side to create remote object references (i.e., IORs) that contain
the name/port of the server (rather than a dotted-decimal/port
pair).</p>
<p>To avoid the call to <code>getHostName</code>, you can set the
following properties (refer to <a href=
"../../tools/share/orbd.html#starting">Starting and Stopping
ORBD</a> if you are not sure how to do this):</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>com.sun.CORBA.ORBServerHost</code> to the DNS name or
dotted-decimal address of the server if the ORB is acting as a
server.</li>
<li>Set <code>com.sun.CORBA.ORBInitialHost</code> to the DNS name
or dotted-decimal address of the name server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: These properties are proprietary and are subject
to deletion or change.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of these suggestions work for you, or if you encounter a
different Sun minor code exception, post a message to the developer
forum at <a href=
"http://forum.java.sun.com/forum.jsp?forum=15">http://forum.java.sun.com</a>.</p>
<p>When requesting the meaning of a minor code please include the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform on which the client and server are running (e.g.,
Solaris, Linux, Win32)</li>
<li>The version of Java SE you are using (e.g., 1.5.0_01)</li>
<li>A complete stack trace</li>
<li>If you are using a naming service or an ORB from a different
vendor, please provide the information on the vendor and version of
the product.</li>
</ul>
