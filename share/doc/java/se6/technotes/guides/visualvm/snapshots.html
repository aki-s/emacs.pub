<h1>Working with Snapshots</h1>
<p>Java VisualVM enables you to take snapshots of application data
and save the snapshots to your local system. Snapshots are a
convenient way to capture data about an application because after a
snapshot is saved it can be opened and viewed at any time. The
target application does not need to be running to view the
snapshot. Snapshots can also be sent and viewed by other
people.</p>
<h2>Snapshot Types</h2>
<p>Snapshots are basically archives of data captured at a point in
time that can then be opened in Java VisualVM. You can take and
save the following types of snapshots:</p>
<h3>Profiler Snapshots</h3>
<p>Profiler snapshots capture profiling data at the moment the
snapshot is taken. You can take a profiler snapshot at any time
during a profiling session. When you take a profiler snapshot, a
node representing the snapshot appears below the application node
in the Applications window and a temporary snapshot file is written
to your local system in the Java VisualVM userdir.</p>
<p>Java VisualVM can take the following types of profiler
snapshots</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory Snapshot.</b> A memory snapshot captures profiling
data on allocated objects. You can take a memory snapshot when you
are using the profiler to analyze memory usage.</li>
<li><b>CPU Snapshot.</b> A CPU snapshot captures data on the
performance of the application. You can take a CPU snapshot when
you are using the profiler to analyze application performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Screenshot of CPU profiling snapshot</p>
<img src="images/profiler-cpu-snapshot.png" style=
"border:1px solid;" alt="screenshot of CPU profiling snapshot"
title="screenshot of CPU profiling snapshot" />
<p>If you want to view a profiler snapshot later, the snapshot must
be explicitly saved to your local system, either as a profiler
snapshot or archived in an application snapshot.</p>
<h4>Taking Profiler Snapshots</h4>
<p>You can take a profiler snapshot during a profiling session.
When you take a memory or CPU snapshot, the snapshot opens in the
application's tab in the main window.</p>
<p>To take a snapshot, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Take Snapshot of Collected Results button in the
Profiler tab</li>
<li>Right-click the application node and choose Profiler
Snapshot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The snapshot toolbar enables you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Save Snapshot to Custom File.</b> Click to save snapshot as
Snapshot file (<tt>.nps</tt> to your local system).</li>
<li><b>Save Current View to Image.</b> Click to save snapshot as an
image (<tt>.png</tt> to your local system)</li>
<li><b>Find in Results.</b> Click to find a search term in the
profiling results.</li>
<li><b>Find Next Occurence.</b> Click to find next occurrence of
search term</li>
<li><b>Find Previous Occurence.</b> Click to find previous
occurrence of search term</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Snapshots</h3>
<p>An application snapshot captures the collected heap dumps,
thread dumps and profiler snapshots of an application at the moment
the snapshot is taken. An application snapshot also captures
general information about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
<p>You take an application snapshot by right-clicking an
application node in the Applications window and choosing
Application Snapshot from the popup menu. Application snapshots are
persisted between Java VisualVM sessions.</p>
<p>When you take an application snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application snapshot node appears under the Snapshots node
in the Applications window</li>
<li>Application data is saved in a folder in the the
<tt>repository/snapshots</tt> folder in the Java VisualVM user
dir</li>
</ul>
<p>Application snapshots are listed under the Snapshots node in the
Applications window. Expand the application snapshot node to view
the contents of the snapshot.</p>

"border:1px solid;" alt=
"screenshot of Applications window showing application snapshots"
title=
"screenshot of Applications window showing application snapshots" />
<p>After you take an application snapshot, you can view and modify
the contents by expanding the application snapshot node in the
Applications window. You can right-click an application snapshot
node or any of the items listed under the application snapshot node
to open the popup menu where you can choose to open, save, rename
and delete the item. You can then save the application snapshot as
a single application snapshot archive (<tt>.apps</tt>) to your
local system.</p>
<p>The Overview tab of an application snapshot captures data about
the JVM software.</p>
