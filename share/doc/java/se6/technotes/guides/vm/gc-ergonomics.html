<h2>Garbage Collector Ergonomics</h2>

The following changes take effect with J2SE 5.0.
<ol>
<li>
<p>On <a href="server-class.html">server-class</a> machines running
the <b>server VM</b>, the garbage collector (GC) has changed from
the previous serial collector (<code>-XX:+UseSerialGC</code>) to a
parallel collector (<code>-XX:+UseParallelGC</code>). You can
override this default by using the <code>-XX:+UseSerialGC</code>
command-line option to the <code>java</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>On <a href="server-class.html">server-class</a> machines
running <b>either VM</b> (client or server) with the parallel
garbage collector (<code>-XX:+UseParallelGC</code>) the initial
heap size and maximum heap size have changed as follows.
<dl>
<dt><b>initial heap size:</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Larger of 1/64th of the machine's physical memory on the machine
or some reasonable minimum. Before J2SE 5.0, the default initial
heap size was a reasonable minimum, which varies by platform. You
can override this default using the <code>-Xms</code> command-line
option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>maximum heap size:</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Smaller of 1/4th of the physical memory or 1GB. Before J2SE 5.0,
the default maximum heap size was 64MB. You can override this
default using the <code>-Xmx</code> command-line option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<b>Note:</b> The boundaries and fractions given for the heap size
are correct for J2SE 5.0. They are likely to be different in
subsequent releases as computers get more powerful.<br />
<hr />
<br /></li>
<li>
<p>The parallel garbage collector (<code>UseParallelGC</code>)
throws an out-of-memory exception if an excessive amount of time is
being spent collecting a small amount of the heap. To avoid this
exception, you can increase the size of the heap. You can also set
the parameters <code>-XX:GCTimeLimit=</code><em>time-limit</em> and
<code>-XX:GCHeapFreeLimit=</code><em>space-limit</em> where:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em><b>time-limit</b></em><b>:</b></dt>
<dd>The upper limit on the amount of time spent in garbage
collection in percent of total time (default is 98).</dd>
<dt><em><b>space-limit</b></em><b>:</b></dt>
<dd>The lower limit on the amount of space freed during a garbage
collection in percent of the maximum heap (default is 2).<br />
<br /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The implementation of <code>-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy</code>
used by default with the <code>-XX:+UseParallelGC</code> garbage
collector has changed to consider three goals:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>a desired maximum GC pause goal</li>
<li>a desired application throughput goal</li>
<li>minimum footprint</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation checks (in this order):</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ol>
<li>If the GC pause time is greater than the pause time goal then
reduce the generations sizes to better attain the goal.</li>
<li>If the pause time goal is being met then consider the
application's throughput goal. If the application's throughput goal
is not being met, then increase the sizes of the generations to
better attain the goal.</li>
<li>If both the pause time goal and the throughput goal are being
met, then the size of the generations are decreased to reduce
footprint.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Flags</b></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<dl>
<dt><code>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=</code><em>nnn</em></dt>
<dd>A hint to the virtual machine that pause times of <em>nnn</em>
milliseconds or less are desired. The VM will adjust the java heap
size and other GC-related parameters in an attempt to keep
GC-induced pauses shorter than <em>nnn</em> milliseconds. Note that
this may cause the VM to reduce overall throughput, and in some
cases the VM will not be able to meet the desired pause time goal.
<p>By default there is no pause time goal. There are definite
limitations on how well a pause time goal can be met. The pause
time for a GC depends on the amount of live data in the heap. The
minor and major collections depend in different ways on the amount
of live data. This parameter should be used with caution. A value
that is too small will cause the system to spend an excessive
amount of time doing garbage collection.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-XX:GCTimeRatio=</code><em>nnn</em></dt>
<dd>A hint to the virtual machine that it's desirable that not more
than 1 / (1 + nnn) of the application execution time be spent in
the collector.
<p>For example <code>-XX:GCTimeRatio=19</code> sets a goal of 5% of
the total time for GC and throughput goal of 95%. That is, the
application should get 19 times as much time as the collector.</p>
<p>By default the value is 99, meaning the application should get
at least 99 times as much time as the collector. That is, the
collector should run for not more than 1% of the total time. This
was selected as a good choice for server applications. A value that
is too high will cause the size of the heap to grow to its
maximum.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Suggested strategy</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not choose a maximum value for the heap unless you know that
the heap is greater than the default maximum heap size. Choose a
throughput goal that is sufficient for your application.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation the heap will grow to a value (less than
the maximum) that will support the chosen throughput goal.</p>
<p>If the heap grows to its maximum, the throughput cannot be met
within that maximum. Set the maximum heap as large as you can, but
no larger than the size of physical memory on the platform, and
execute the application again. If the throughput goal can still not
be met, then it is too high for the available memory on the
platform.</p>
<p>If the throughput goal can be met but there are pauses that are
too long, select a pause time goal. This will likely mean that your
throughput goal will not be met, so choose values that are an
acceptable compromise for the application.</p>
