<h1>Signature Timestamp Support<br />
for J2SE 5.0</h1>

<h2><a name="INTRO" id="INTRO">Introduction</a></h2>
This document describes the enhancements that have been added in
J2SE 5.0 to support signature timestamps. Please send feedback,
especially those related to these new features, to <a href=
"mailto:java-security@sun.com">java-security@sun.com</a>.
<p>Prior to J2SE 5.0, the signature generated by
<code>jarsigner</code> contained no information about w hen the
signature was generated. With no other information available,
systems/deployers (including users of the Java Plug-in) often based
their validity assessment of a signed JAR file on the validity of
the signing certificate. When the signing certificate expires,
systems/deployers conclude that the signature, and hence, the JAR
file, has expired. Because signing certificates typically expire
annually, this caused customers significant problems by forcing
them to re-sign deployed JAR files annually.</p>
<p>Starting in J2SE 5.0, <code>jarsigner</code> can generate
signatures that include a timestamp, thus enabling systems/deployer
(including Java Plug-in) to check whether the JAR file was signed
while the signing certificate was still valid. In addition, APIs
were added in J2SE 5.0 to allow applications to obtain the
timestamp information.</p>
<p>The following time-of-signing enhancements and additions are
supported in version 5.0 of the Java 2 platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#JARSIGNER">Jarsigner Enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="#JAVAPLUGIN">Java Plug-in Enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="#APIENHANCE">API Enhancements</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="JARSIGNER" id="JARSIGNER">Jarsigner
Enhancements</a></h2>
The <code>jarsigner</code> tool can now generate and store a
signature timestamp when signing a JAR file. In addition,
<code>jarsigner</code> supports alternative signing mechanisms.
This behavior is optional and is controlled by the user at the time
of signing through the options described below.
<h3>Jarsigner Timestamp Options</h3>
The following options were added to the <code>jarsigner</code> tool
to support signature timestamps:
<p><code>-tsa url</code></p>
<blockquote>If <code>"-tsa http://example.tsa.url"</code> appears
on the command line when signing a JAR file then a timestamp is
generated for the signature. The URL,
<code>http://example.tsa.url</code>, identifies the location of the
Time Stamping Authority (TSA). It overrides any URL found via the
<code>-tsacert</code> option. The <code>-tsa</code> option does not
require the TSA's public key certificate to be present in the
keystore.
<p>To generate the timestamp, <code>jarsigner</code> communicates
with the TSA using the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) defined in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt">RFC 3161</a>. If
successful, the timestamp token returned by the TSA is stored along
with the signature in the signature block file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>-tsacert alias</code></p>
<blockquote>If <code>"-tsacert alias"</code> appears on the command
line when signing a JAR file then a timestamp is generated for the
signature. The <code>alias</code> identifies the TSA's public key
certificate in the keystore that is currently in effect. The
entry's certificate is examined for a Subject Information Access
extension that contains a URL identifying the location of the TSA.
<p>The TSA's public key certificate must be present in the keystore
when using <code>-tsacert</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Alternative Signing Options</h3>
<h4>Specifying an Alternative Signing Mechanism</h4>
<code>-altsigner class</code>
<blockquote>Specifies that an alternative signing mechanism be
used. The fully-qualified class name identifies a class file that
extends the <code>com.sun.jarsigner.ContentSigner abstract
class</code>. The path to this class file is defined by the
<code>-altsignerpath</code> option. If the <code>-altsigner</code>
option is used, <code>jarsigner</code> uses the signing mechanism
provided by the specified class. Otherwise, <code>jarsigner</code>
uses its default signing mechanism.
<p>For example, to use the signing mechanism provided by a class
named <code>com.sun.sun.jarsigner.AuthSigner</code>, use the
<code>jarsigner</code> option <code>"-altsigner
com.sun.jarsigner.AuthSigner"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Specifying Path to Alternative Signing Mechanism</h4>
<code>-altsignerpath classpathlist</code>
<blockquote>Specifies the path to the class file (the class file
name is specified with the <code>-altsigner</code> option described
above) and any JAR files it depends on. If the class file is in a
JAR file, then this specifies the path to that JAR file, as shown
in the example below.
<p>An absolute path or a path relative to the current directory may
be specified. If <code>classpathlist</code> contains multiple paths
or JAR files, they should be separated with a colon
(<code>:</code>) on Solaris and a semi-colon (<code>;</code>) on
Windows. This option is not necessary if the class is already in
the search path.</p>
<p>Example of specifying the path to a jar file that contains the
class file:</p>
<p><code>-altsignerpath /home/user/lib/authsigner.jar</code></p>
<p>Note that the JAR file name is included.</p>
<p>Example of specifying the path to the jar file that contains the
class file:</p>
<p><code>-altsignerpath
/home/user/classes/com/sun/tools/jarsigner/</code></p>
<p>Note that the JAR file name is omitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="JAVAPLUGIN" id="JAVAPLUGIN">Java Plug-in
Enhancements</a></h2>
In J2SE 5.0, the Java Plug-in was enhanced to check signature
timestamps (if available) when validating JAR files. The Java
Plug-in will no longer present a dialog when it encounters an
expired or revoked certificate when validating a signed jar,
provided that the signature timestamp confirms that the signature
was generated prior to the expiration or revocation date.
<p>The TSA's certificate must be available from the Plug-in's
keystore or certificate stores when the Plug-in is validating a JAR
file containing a signature timestamp.</p>
<p>The Plugin reverts to 1.4.x behavior if the signature does not
contain a timestamp.</p>
<h2><a name="APIENHANCE" id="APIENHANCE">API Enhancements</a></h2>
The security and JAR APIs were enhanced to enable applications to
access timestamp information.
<p>Two new classes were added to the <tt>java.security</tt>
package. These classes are <a href=
"../../../api/java/security/CodeSigner.html">CodeSigner</a>, which
maintains information associated with a signer, and <a href=
"../../../api/java/security/Timestamp.html">Timestamp</a>, which
represents information associated with a signature timestamp.</p>
<p>New methods were added to the <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/security/CodeSource.html#getCodeSigners()">java.security.CodeSource</a></tt>
class and <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/util/jar/JarEntry.html#getCodeSigners()">java.util.jar.JarEntry</a></tt>
class to allow access to this new, optional information.</p>
