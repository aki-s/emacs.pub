<h1>Kerberos Requirements</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Kerberos Version 5 is used for both the authentication and
secure communication aspects of the client and server applications
developed in this tutorial. The reader is assumed to already be
familiar with Kerberos. See the <a href=
"http://web.MIT.edu/kerberos/www/index.html">Kerberos reference
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The JAAS framework, and the Kerberos mechanism required by the
Java GSS-API methods, are built into the version 1.4 and later JREs
from all vendors. (JAAS was available as a separately-downloadable
optional package starting in version 1.3.) The Kerberos LoginModule
required for the JAAS authentication in this tutorial may not be
available in all vendors' JREs. We will be using the LoginModule
for Kerberos provided in the JRE from Sun Microsystems (versions
1.4 and later).</p>
<p>In order to run the sample programs, you will need access to a
Kerberos installation. As described in the following sections, you
may also need a <code>krb5.conf</code> Kerberos configuration file
and an indication as to where that file is located.</p>
<p>As with all Kerberos installations, a Kerberos Key Distribution
Center (KDC) is required. It needs to contain the user name and
password you will use to be authenticated to Kerberos. Note: A KDC
implementation is part of a Kerberos installation and not a part of
the JRE v 1.4 and later.</p>
<p>As with most Kerberos installations, a Kerberos configuration
file <code>krb5.conf</code> is consulted to determine such things
as the default realm and KDC. If you are using a Kerberos
implementation such as that from Microsoft for Windows 2000, which
does not include a <code>krb5.conf</code> file, you will either
need to create one or use system properties as described in
<a href="#SetProps">Setting Properties to Indicate the Default
Realm and KDC</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SetProps" id="SetProps">Setting Properties to Indicate
the Default Realm and KDC</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, the default realm and the KDC for that realm are
indicated in the Kerberos <code>krb5.conf</code> configuration
file. However, if you like, you can instead specify these values by
setting the following system properties to indicate the realm and
KDC, respectively:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
java.security.krb5.realm <br />java.security.krb5.kdc<br />
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If you set one of these properties you must set them both.</p>
<p>Also note that if you set these properties, then no cross-realm
authentication is possible unless a <code>krb5.conf</code> file is
also provided from which the additional information required for
cross-realm authentication may be obtained.</p>
<p>If you set values for these properties, then they override the
default realm and KDC values specified in <code>krb5.conf</code>
(if such a file is found). The <code>krb5.conf</code> file is still
consulted if values for items other than the default realm and KDC
are needed. If no <code>krb5.conf</code> file is found, then the
default values used for these items are
implementation-specific.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Locating the <code>krb5.conf</code> Configuration File</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential Kerberos configuration information is the default
realm and the default KDC. As shown in <a href="#SetProps">Setting
Properties to Indicate the Default Realm and KDC</a>, if you set
properties to indicate these values, they are not obtained from a
<code>krb5.conf</code> configuration file.</p>
<p>If these properties do not have values set, or if other Kerberos
configuration information is needed, an attempt is made to find the
required information in a <code>krb5.conf</code> file. The
algorithm to locate the <code>krb5.conf</code> file is the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the system property <code>java.security.krb5.conf</code> is
set, its value is assumed to specify the path and file name.</li>
<li>If that system property value is not set, then the
configuration file is looked for in the directory
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;java-home&gt;\lib\security      [Windows]<br />&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security      [Solaris and Linux]<br />
</pre></blockquote>
Here <tt>&lt;java-home&gt;</tt> refers to the directory where the
JRE was installed. For example, if you have J2SE 5.0 installed on
Solaris in a directory named <code>/j2sdk1.5</code>, the directory
in which the configuration file is looked for is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
/j2sdk1.5/jre/lib/security <br />
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>If the file is still not found, then an attempt is made to
locate it as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/krb5/krb5.conf                [Solaris]<br />c:\winnt\krb5.ini                  [Windows]<br />/etc/krb5.conf                     [Linux]<br />
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>If the file is still not found, and the configuration
information being searched for is <i>not</i> the default realm and
KDC, then implementation-specific defaults are used. If, on the
other hand, the configuration information being searched for is the
default realm and KDC because they weren't specified in system
properties, and the <code>krb5.conf</code> file is not found
either, then an exception is thrown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Naming Conventions for Realm Names and Hostnames</h2>
<blockquote>By convention, all Kerberos realm names are uppercase
and all DNS hostname and domain names are lowercase. On the Windows
2000 platform, domains are also Kerberos realms; however, the realm
name is always the uppercase version of the domain name.
<p>Hostnames are case insensitive and by convention they are all
lowercase. They must resolve to the same hostname on the client and
server by their respective naming services.</p>
<p>However, in the Kerberos database hostnames are case sensitive.
In all host-based Kerberos service principals in the KDC, hostnames
are case-sensitive. The hostnames used in the Kerberos service
principal names must exactly match the hostnames returned by the
naming service. For example, if the naming service returns a fully
qualified lowercased DNS hostname, such as
"<code>raven.sun.com</code>", then the administrator must use the
same fully qualified lowercased DNS hostname when creating
host-based principal names in the KDC:
"<code>host/raven.sun.com</code>".</p>

<h2>Cross-Realm Authentication</h2>
<blockquote>In cross-realm authentication, a principal in one realm
can authenticate to principals in another realm.
<p>In Kerberos, cross-realm authentication is implemented by
sharing an encryption key between two realms. The KDCs in two
different realms share a special cross-realm secret; this secret is
used to prove identity when crossing the boundary between
realms.</p>
<p>The key that is shared is the Ticket Granting Service
principal's key. Here's a typical Ticket Granting Service principal
for a single realm:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
ktbtgt/ACME.COM@ACME.COM
</pre></blockquote>
In cross realm authentication, two principals are created on each
participating realm. For two realms, <code>ENG.EAST.ACME.COM</code>
and <code>SALES.WEST.ACME.COM</code>, these principals would be:
<blockquote>
<pre>
krbtgt/ENG.EAST.ACME.COM@SALES.WEST.ACME.COM
krbtgt/SALES.WEST.ACME.COM@ENG.EAST.ACME.COM
</pre></blockquote>
These principals, known as remote Ticket Granting Server
principals, must be created on both realms.
<p>On Windows 2000 KDC, the <code>krbtgt</code> account is created
automatically when a Windows 2000 domain is created. This account
cannot be deleted and renamed.</p>
<h3>Types of Realms</h3>
<blockquote>When you set up multiple realms, you must decide if
your realm configuration will be "hierarchical" (one realm is a
superset of the other) or "direct" (the mapping between realms must
be defined). 
<!-- For more information, refer to this Sun documentation: 
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/805-5500/6j56o02oo?a=view">Configuring 
Cross-Realm Authentication</a>. --></blockquote>
<h3>How to Set Up Cross-Realm Authentication</h3>
<blockquote>In transitive cross-realm authentication you can define
a path of realms connected via cross-realm secrets and use this
path to traverse realms until you get credentials in the desired
realm.
<p>The <code>[capaths]</code> section in the Kerberos configuration
file defines a series of authentication paths used for transitive
cross-realm authentication. Clients use <code>[capaths]</code> to
determine the correct path for doing transitive cross-realm
authentication. Application servers check the
<code>[capaths]</code> section to determine if a cross-realm
authentication path is valid.</p>
<p>For example, to set-up cross realm authentication between
<code>ENG.EAST.ACME.COM</code> and
<code>SALES.WEST.ACME.COM</code>, <code>krb5.conf</code> should
include the following entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
[capaths]
    ENG.EAST.ACME.COM = {
        SALES.WEST.ACME.COM = .
    }

    SALES.WEST.ACME.COM = {
         ENG.EAST.ACME.COM = .
    }
</pre></blockquote>
On Windows 2000, you must set up a trust relationship between the
two realms. For configuration details, refer to <a href=
