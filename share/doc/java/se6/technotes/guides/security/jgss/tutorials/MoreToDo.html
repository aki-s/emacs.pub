<h1>More Things You Can Do With Java GSS-API and JAAS</h1>

<br />
<br />
<p>The previous tutorial, <a href="ClientServer.html">Use of JAAS
Login Utility and Java GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges</a>,
demonstrated how two applications, in particular a client and a
server, could use the Java GSS-API to establish a secure context
between them and then securely exchange messages.</p>
<p>There are additional operations the context acceptor (the server
in our client/server example) can perform once the context has been
established with the context initiator (the client). Basically, the
server can "impersonate" the client. The level of impersonation
depends upon whether or not the client has delegated credentials to
the server.</p>

<h1>Executing Code on Behalf of the Client User</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible type of client impersonation the server can do is
causing code to be executed on behalf of the same entity (user) the
client code is executed on behalf of. Normally, a method executed
by a thread uses the access control settings for that thread
itself. However, when impersonating a client in this tutorial, the
server uses the client's access control settings so that the server
has access to exactly those resources that the client itself has
when it runs.</p>
<p>One major benefit of the approach used in this tutorial is that
the JAAS authorization component can be used for access control.
Without the JAAS authorization component, the server principal
would need access to any resources accessed by the code executed on
behalf of the client user, and the server code would need to
include access control logic to determine whether the user was
authorized to access such resources. By utilizing JAAS
authorization, providing principal-based access control, the access
control is handled automatically. Permissions for the
security-sensitive operations in such code only need to be granted
to that user and not also to the server code. See the <a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a> tutorial for more
information on JAAS authorization.</p>

<a name="BasicApp" id="BasicApp"></a>
<h2>Basic Approach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the server "impersonate" the client to execute code on
behalf of the user running the client code? Essentially the same
way the client code is set up to be run on behalf of that user. All
the server code needs to know is the user's principal name, which
it can obtain from the context established with the client.</p>
<p>Recall that JAAS authentication of the user executing the client
code results in creation of a Subject containing a Principal with
the user (principal) name. The Subject is subsequently associated
with a new access control context (via a
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> call from the Login utility)
and the client code is considered to be executed on behalf of the
user; subsequent access control decisions are based on whether or
not that particular user, executing the client code, is granted the
required permissions.</p>
<p>The server code is similarly handled, except in that case the
Principal specified for authentication is typically a "service
principal", not a user principal. Again, a Subject containing a
Principal with the specified principal name is created,
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> is called, and the server code
is considered to be executed on behalf of the specified principal;
subsequent access control decisions are based on whether or not
that particular principal, executing the server code, is granted
the required permissions.</p>
<p>Once the client and server have established a mutual context,
the context initiator's name (the client's principal name) can be
determined by the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
GSSName clientGSSName = context.getSrcName();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The context acceptor (the server) can use this name to construct
a Subject containing a Principal that represents the same entity.
For example, if you are using a JRE from Sun Microsystems, you can
construct such a Subject via the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject client = 
  com.sun.security.jgss.GSSUtil.createSubject(clientGSSName, null);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The <a href=
"../../../../../jre/api/security/jgss/spec/com/sun/security/jgss/GSSUtil.html#createSubject(org.ietf.jgss.GSSName,%20org.ietf.jgss.GSSCredential)">
createSubject</a> method creates a new Subject from the GSSName and
GSSCredential specified as arguments. If the server code is just
going to execute code on behalf of the user in the local JVM, the
user's credentials are not required - and in fact cannot even be
obtained unless the client has delegated credentials to the server,
as discussed in <a href="#DelCr">Using Credentials Delegated From
the Client</a>. Since the credentials are not needed here, we pass
a <code>null</code> for the GSSCredential argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
Note: If you are not using a JRE from Sun Microsystems, an
alternative way to do this is to construct a KerberosPrincipal
instance as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
KerberosPrincipal principal = 
  new KerberosPrincipal(clientGSSName.toString());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Then use this principal to construct a new Subject or populate
this principal in the principal set of an existing Subject.</p>
<hr /></blockquote>
<p>The code that the server would like to execute on behalf of the
user should be initiated from the <code>run</code> method of a
class that implements <code>java.security.PrivilegedAction</code>
(or <code>java.security.PrivilegedExceptionAction</code>). That is,
the code can either be in such a <code>run</code> method or invoked
from such a <code>run</code> method.</p>
<p>The server code can pass the Subject, along with an instance of
the PrivilegedAction (or PrivilegedExceptionAction), to
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> to execute the subsequent code,
starting with the <code>run</code> method in the PrivilegedAction,
on behalf of the principal (user) in the specified Subject.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the PrivilegedAction class is called
ReadFileAction and it takes as an argument a String with the
principal name. You can create an instance of this class by</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
String clientName = clientGSSName.toString();
PrivilegedAction readFile = 
    new ReadFileAction(clientName);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The call to <code>doAsPrivileged</code> is then</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject.doAsPrivileged(client, readFile, null);
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Sample Code and Policy File</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following sample code and policy file illustrate the server
impersonating the client in order to execute code whose
security-sensitive operations are only permitted to be done by the
specific user executing the client.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#SSI">SampleServerImp.java</a></li>
<li><a href="#ReadFileAction">ReadFileAction.java</a></li>
<li><a href="#SSIPolicy">serverimp.policy</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="SSI" id="SSI"></a>
<h3>SampleServerImp.java</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="SampleServerImp.java">SampleServerImp.java</a> file
is exactly the same as the SampleServer.java file from the previous
(<a href="ClientServer.html">Use of JAAS Login Utility and Java
GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges</a>) tutorial, except that
after exchanging messages with the client, it has the following
code to perform a <code>ReadFileAction</code> as the client
user:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
System.out.println("Impersonating client.");

/*
 * Extract the KerberosPrincipal from the client GSSName and 
 * populate it in the principal set of a new Subject. Pass in a 
 * null for credentials since credentials will not be needed.
 */
GSSName clientGSSName = <b>context.getSrcName</b>();
System.out.println("clientGSSName: " + clientGSSName);
Subject client =
   com.sun.security.jgss.GSSUtil.<b>createSubject</b>(clientGSSName,
        null);

/*
* Construct an action that will read a file meant only for the
* client
*/
String clientName = clientGSSName.toString();
PrivilegedAction readFile = 
   new <b>ReadFileAction</b>(clientName);

/*
* Invoke the action via a doAsPrivileged. This allows the
* action to be executed as the client subject, and it also 
* runs that code as privileged. This means that any permission 
* checking that happens beyond this point applies only to 
* the code being run as the client.
*/
<b>Subject.doAsPrivileged</b>(client, readFile, null);
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<a name="ReadFileAction" id="ReadFileAction"></a>
<h3>ReadFileAction.java</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="ReadFileAction.java">ReadFileAction.java</a> file
contains the ReadFileAction class. Its constructor takes as an
argument a String for the name of the client user. The client
username is used to construct a file name for a file from which
ReadFileAction will attempt to read. The file name will be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
./data/&lt;name&gt;_info.txt
</pre></blockquote>
where &lt;name&gt; is the client username without its corresponding
realm. For example, if the full username is
<code>mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM</code>, then the file name is
<blockquote>
<pre>
./data/mjones_info.txt
</pre></blockquote>
Note: On Microsoft Windows systems the forward slashes will be
backward slashes.
<p>The ReadFileAction <code>run</code> method reads the specified
file and prints its contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="SSIPolicy" id="SSIPolicy"></a>
<h3>serverimp.policy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ReadFileAction attempts to read a file, which is a
security-checked operation. Since ReadFileAction is considered to
be executed as the client user (Principal), the appropriate
permission must be granted not only to the ReadFileAction code
itself, but to the client Principal as well.</p>
<p>Assuming the <code>ReadFileAction</code> class is placed in a
JAR file named <code>ReadFileAction.jar</code>, and the user
principal name is <code>mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM</code>,
this permission can be granted via the following in a policy
file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
grant CodeBase "file:./ReadFileAction.jar" 
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM" {

    permission java.io.FilePermission "data/mjones_info.txt", 
        "read";
};
</pre></blockquote>
The <a href="serverimp.policy">serverimp.policy</a> file is exactly
the same as the <code>server.policy</code> file from the previous
(<a href="ClientServer.html">Use of JAAS Login Utility and Java
GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges</a>) tutorial, except that it
grants the SampleServer code the
<code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "doAsPrivileged"</code>
permission it needs in order to call the
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> method, and it has the following
placeholder for granting the FilePermission shown above:
<blockquote>
<pre>
grant CodeBase "file:./ReadFileAction.jar" 
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm" {

    permission java.io.FilePermission "data/your_user_name_info.txt", 
        "read";
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>You must substitute your Kerberos realm for
<code>your_realm</code>, and your user name for
<code>your_user_name</code> in both
<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code> and
<code>data/your_user_name_info.txt</code>. If you are working on a
Microsoft Windows sytem, you also replace the "/" in
<code>data/your_user_name_info.txt</code> with a "\".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<a name="RunCode" id="RunCode"></a>
<h2>Running the Sample Code</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To run the sample code illustrating the server impersonating the
client, do everything listed in <a href=
"ClientServer.html#RunProgs">Running the SampleClient and
SampleServer Programs</a> in the previous tutorial, except for the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the "Prepare SampleServer for Execution" step:
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="SampleServerImp.java">SampleServerImp.java</a>
instead of <code>SampleServer.java</code>. Compile it and create a
JAR file named <code>SampleServerImp.jar</code> containing
<code>SampleServerImp.class</code> via the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
javac SampleServerImp.java
jar -cvf SampleServerImp.jar SampleServerImp.class
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="serverimp.policy">serverimp.policy</a> policy
file instead of <code>server.policy</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="csImpLogin.conf">csImpLogin.conf</a> login
configuration file instead of <code>cs.conf</code>.</li>
<li>Copy <a href="ReadFileAction.java">ReadFileAction.java</a> to
the same directory as the other files. Compile it and place it in a
JAR file via the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
javac ReadFileAction.java
jar -cvf ReadFileAction.jar ReadFileAction.class
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>In <code>csImpLogin.conf</code>, replace
"service_principal@your_realm" with <a href=
"ClientServer.html#KerbNames">the Kerberos name of the service
principal that represents SampleServer</a>.</li>
<li>In <code>serverimp.policy</code>, replace
"service_principal@your_realm" in both places it appears with the
Kerberos name of the service principal that represents
SampleServer. (The same name as that used in the login
configuration file.) In addition, substitute your Kerberos realm
for <code>your_realm</code>, and your user name for
<code>your_user_name</code> in both
<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code> and
<code>data/your_user_name_info.txt</code>. If you are running on a
Microsoft Windows system, then replace the "/" in
<code>data/your_user_name_info.txt</code> with a "\".</li>
<li>Create a <code>data</code> subdirectory of your current
directory and create a short text file of the specified name in
that directory. For example, if your user name is
<code>mjones</code>, the file to be placed in the data subdirectory
should be named <code>mjones_info.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the "Execute SampleServer" step:
<ul>
<li>Use the following commands instead of those specified in that
section so that <code>SampleServerImp</code> is executed,
<code>serverimp.policy</code> and <code>csImpLogin.conf</code> are
used, and <code>ReadFileAction.jar</code> is included.
<p><b>Important: In these commands, you must replace
<code>&lt;port_number&gt;</code> with an appropriate port number (a
high port number such as 4444), <code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
with your Kerberos realm, and <code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with
your Kerberos KDC.</b></p>
<p>Here is the command for Microsoft Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
  java -classpath Login.jar;SampleServerImp.jar;ReadFileAction.jar 
    -Djava.security.manager 
    -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
    -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
    -Djava.security.policy=serverimp.policy 
    -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csImpLogin.conf 
    Login SampleServerImp &lt;port_number&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Here is the command for UNIX systems:</p>
<pre>
  java -classpath Login.jar:SampleServerImp.jar:ReadFileAction.jar 
    -Djava.security.manager 
    -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
    -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
    -Djava.security.policy=serverimp.policy 
    -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csImpLogin.conf 
    Login SampleServerImp &lt;port_number&gt;
</pre>
<p>As usual, type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are
used here for legibility. If the command is too long for your
system, you may need to place it in a .bat file (for Microsoft
Windows) or a .sh file (for UNIX) and then run that file to execute
the command.</p>
<p>As when running SampleServer, you will be prompted for the
Kerberos password for the service principal under which
SampleServerImp is expected to be run. The Kerberos login module
specified in the login configuration file will log the service
principal into Kerberos. Once authentication is successfully
completed, the <code>SampleServerImp</code> code will be executed
on behalf of the service principal. It will listen for socket
connections on the specified port.</p>
<p>After you follow the "Prepare SampleClient for Execution" and
"Execute SampleClient" instructions as usual and perform the user
login, the client code will request a socket connection with
SampleServerImp. Once SampleServerImp accepts the connection,
SampleClient and SampleServerImp establish a shared context and
then exchange messages as described in the previous tutorial.</p>
<p>After the message exchange, SampleServerImp determines the
principal name of the user executing the client code, creates a new
Subject containing a Principal with that name, and calls
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> to execute the code in
ReadFileAction on behalf of the specified user. ReadFileAction
reads the file named <code>your_user_name_info.txt</code> (where
<code>your_user_name</code> represents the actual user name) in the
<code>data</code> subdirectory of the current directory, and prints
out its contents.</p>

<a name="DelCr" id="DelCr"></a>
<h1>Using Credentials Delegated From the Client</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The most complete type of client impersonation is possible if
the client delegates its credentials to the server.</p>
<p>Recall that prior to context establishment with the context
acceptor (the server in our previous tutorial), the context
initiator (the client) sets various context options. If the
initiator calls the <code>requestCredDeleg</code> method on the
<code>context</code> object with a <code>true</code> argument, as
in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
context.requestCredDeleg(true);
</pre></blockquote>
then this requests that the initiator's credentials be delegated to
the acceptor during context establishment.
<p>Delegation of credentials from the initiator to the acceptor
enables the acceptor to authenticate itself as an agent or delegate
of the initiator.</p>
<p>First, after context establishment, the acceptor must determine
whether or not credential delegation actually took place. It does
so by calling the <code>getCredDelegState</code> method:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
boolean delegated = context.getCredDelegState();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If credentials were delegated, the acceptor can obtain those
credentials by calling the <code>getDelegCr</code> method:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
GSSCredential clientCr = context.getDelegCr();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The resulting GSSCredential object can then be used to initiate
subsequent GSS-API contexts as a "delegate" of the initiator. For
example, the server could authenticate as the client to a backend
server that cares more about who the original client was than who
the intermediate server is.</p>
<p>Acting as the client, the server can establish a connection with
the backend server, establish a joint security context, and
exchange messages in basically the same manner that the client and
server did.</p>
<p>One way it could be done is that when the server calls the
<code>createContext</code> method of a GSSManager, it could pass
<code>createContext</code> the delegated credentials instead of
passing a <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the server code could first call the
<code>com.sun.security.jgss.GSSUtil createSubject</code> method and
pass it the delegated credentials. That method returns a Subject
containing those credentials as the default credentials. The server
could then associate this Subject with the current
AccessControlContext, as described in <a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html#AssocSubject">How Do You Associate a Subject with
an Access Control Context?</a> in the JAAS Authorization tutorial.
Then, when the server code calls the GSSManager
<code>createContext</code> method, it can pass a null (indicating
the credentials for the "current" Subject should be used). In other
words, the server would effectively become the client. Subsequent
connections to backend servers using GSS could be made exactly as
described in the previous tutorials. This approach is useful if you
want the code that will use the delegated credentials to be
identical to the code that uses the default local credentials.</p>
<h2>Permission Required In Order to Delegate Credentials</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to delegate credentials, the context initiator
(SampleClient in our previous tutorial) must have a
<code>javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission</code>. An
example using placeholders in italics for actual values is the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission
  "\"<i>service_principal@your_realm</i>\"  
     \"krbtgt/<i>your_realm</i>@<i>your_realm</i>\"";
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Note that DelegationPermission has a single target in quotes
that contains two items, both of which are quoted. Each inner quote
is escaped by a "\". Thus the first item is</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
"<i>service_principal@your_realm</i>"
</pre></blockquote>
and the second is
<blockquote>
<pre>
"krbtgt/<i>your_realm</i>@<i>your_realm</i>"
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This basically gives the code executing on behalf of the client
the permission to forward a Kerberos ticket to the specified peer
(service_principal), where the Kerberos ticket is meant to avail
service from
<code>krbtgt/<i>your_realm</i>@<i>your_realm</i></code>.</p>
<p>Substitute your realm for all places
<code><i>your_realm</i></code> appears. Also substitute the service
principal name for the service principal representing the server
for <code><i>service_principal@your_realm</i></code>. (See <a href=
"ClientServer.html#KerbNames">Kerberos User and Service Principal
Names</a> in the previous tutorial.) Suppose your realm is
KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM and the service principal is
"sample/raven.abc.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM". Then the
permission could appear in a policy file as</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission
  "\"sample/raven.abc.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM\"  
     \"krbtgt/KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM\"";
</pre></blockquote>
