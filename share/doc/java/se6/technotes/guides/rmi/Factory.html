<h1><b>Applying the Factory Pattern to Java<sup><font size=
"-2">TM</font></sup> RMI</b></h1>

<p>What is a "factory" and why would you want to use one? A
factory, in this context, is a piece of software that implements
one of the "factory" design patterns introduced in the book,
<a href=
"http://www.awprofessional.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={E1CD5BE7-E008-481B-8D0C-8E80CE9978F9}">
Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.</a>
In general, a factory implementation is useful when you need one
object to control the creation of and/or access to other objects.By
using a factory in Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Remote
Method Invocation (Java RMI), you can reduce the number of objects
that you need to register with the Java RMI registry.</p>
<h2>Examples of Factories in the Real World:</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Bank</h3>
<p>When you go to the bank to make a deposit to your account, you
<i>don't</i> walk up to a vault, pull out a drawer with your name
on it, drop in your money, shut the drawer and leave. Think about
how you originally established, or <i>opened</i>, the account. You
probably went to the bank, spoke with an Account Manager, and
signed some papers. In return, they gave you some checks, a
passbook, or a bank card so you could access your account in the
future.</p>
<p>The Account Manager is an example of a factory. The person or
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that acts as account manager
controls the creation of and/or access to individual accounts.</p>
<h3>The Library</h3>
Let's think about how a book, compact disk, or video tape gets from
the library shelf into your home. Before you can check out any
material, you must first get a library card from the librarian. In
this case, the librarian could be viewed as a <i>library card</i>
factory because the librarian controls the creation of new library
card instances.
<p>Once you have a library card, you can go into the library, and
without any further fuss, just walk out with all your materials,
right? Of course not. Before you can walk out of the library
without setting off the alarm system, you must <i>check out</i> the
book, CD, or video tape you wish to take home. So you present your
library card to, you guessed it, the librarian, who will use your
card to access the library database to see if you owe any late
fees, and to register these new materials as having been leased to
you. In this case, the librarian could be seen as a <i>book</i>
factory because the librarian controls your access to the
books.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How Does a Factory Work in Java RMI?</h2>
<p>Just like any other Java RMI program, there are a few basic
players: a server that produces one or more remote objects, each of
which implements a remote interface; a client that accesses a name
server (the <code>rmiregistry</code>) to get a reference to one of
the remote objects; and the <code>rmiregistry</code>, which
facilitates the client's initial contact with the server.</p>
<p>For the picture below and the steps that follow, you may make
the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two remote interfaces that the client understands,
<code>Factory</code> and <code>Product</code></li>
<li>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> implements the
<code>Factory</code> interface and the <code>ProductImpl</code>
implements the <code>Product</code> interface</li>
</ul>

"Illustrates the 6 actions listed below." />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li style="list-style: none"><br /></li>
<li>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> registers, or is registered, with
the <code>rmiregistry</code></li>
<li>The client requests a reference to a <code>Factory</code></li>
<li>The <code>rmiregistry</code> returns a remote reference to a
<code>FactoryImpl</code></li>
<li>The client invokes a remote method on the
<code>FactoryImpl</code> to obtain a remote reference to a
<code>ProductImpl</code></li>
<li>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> returns a remote reference to an
existing <code>ProductImpl</code> or to one that it just created,
based on the client request</li>
<li>The client invokes a remote method on the
<code>ProductImpl</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>How Could the Bank and Library be Implemented in Java RMI?</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Bank</h3>
<p>In code, <code>AccountManager</code> would be a remote interface
with one or more remote methods. These methods would return objects
that implement the <code>Account</code> interface. In a similar
fashion, <code>Account</code> would be an interface that declared
all of the operations a person could perform on an account
instance, such as depositing or withdrawing money, getting an
account balance, or listing the most recent account
transactions.</p>
<p>In Java RMI, only the instance of the
<code>AccountManager</code> implementation would be registered with
the Java RMI registry. The <code>AccountManager</code>
implementation would be the factory, returning remote references to
(or serialized instances of) <code>Account</code> implementations,
like your savings account.</p>
<h3>The Library</h3>
<p>In the library example, the <code>Librarian</code> would be a
remote interface with one or more methods that would return objects
that implement the <code>LibraryCard</code> interface. In addition,
the <code>Librarian</code> interface would have methods to allow
you access to books, CDs, or videotapes that implemented the
<code>Loanable</code> interface.</p>
<p>In Java RMI, only the instance of the <code>Librarian</code>
implementation would be registered with the Java RMI registry. The
<code>Librarian</code> implementation would be the factory,
returning remote references to (or serialized instances of)
<code>LibraryCard</code> implementations and <code>Loanable</code>
object implementations.</p>
